I think that the proposers of the Bill would say that it has three main aims. As I summarise them. I hone that I do no injustice to their case. If I do, I will willingly give way. As I see it, they rest upon three main arguments: first, that there is need for certainty in the law: secondly, that the present law if rendered certain is inhumane inhumane because there are many cases in which motherhood will impose severe emotional strains inhumane because the child is likely to be born abnormal or defective: inhumane because the circumstances of the conception are such as to render the birth of the child repugnant to the mother, her family or society at large: inhumane because the law insists on a woman bearing an unwanted child.
