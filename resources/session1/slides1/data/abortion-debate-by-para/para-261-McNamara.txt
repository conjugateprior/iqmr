But the phrase is another matter. The question has already been raised of the difficulty of proving rape legally. My medical informants tell me that tearing, scratching, bruises, are not uncommon accompaniments of normal sexual intercourse. Here the doctor, on the uncorroborated evidence of his patient, is to be placed in the position of judge and jury. It is an impossible position for him to be placed in and the whole of this subsection begs the question of the proof of rape.
