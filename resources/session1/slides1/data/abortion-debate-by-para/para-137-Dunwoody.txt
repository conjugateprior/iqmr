Finally, I must say, as a doctor, that I support the Bill primarily not on medical grounds but social grounds. This is a piece of social legislation rather than medical legislation. I should like to congratulate the hon. Member for Roxburgh, Selkirk and Peebles upon introducing this Bill. I think it is not always easy for a back bencher, particularly those of us whose security of tenure here is perhaps not as great as we would like it to be, to introduce as a Private Member's Bill a Measure like this.
