There may be a consensus among doctors on this subject, but it is unwise to calculate here too much by consensuses. Certainly, there is a minority of doctors averse to the termination of pregnancies in any circumstances. There must be a majority who strongly support the termination of pregnancies in particular circumstances. There is another minority, a small minority, willing to consider termination of pregnancies without too close regard to circumstances. I would only stress that there is a need to bring them into account in a matter which goes so close to the heart of medical ethics.
