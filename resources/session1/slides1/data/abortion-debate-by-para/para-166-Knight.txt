I had concluded my speech, but I hope the House will allow me to answer that question. I said then, as I say now, and as I said in my speech, that I would support abortion after rape. I said that only a few minutes ago. In my letters to my constituents I have stated precisely the circumstances in which I would support abortion, and I touched on them again today. If the hon. Lady's correspondent has sent her the whole of my letter, she will know that on every occasion I said that I could not support abortion on demand. That is what I said then, and that is what I say now.
