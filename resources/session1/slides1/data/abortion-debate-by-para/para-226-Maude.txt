With respect to the hon. Gentleman the Member for Roxburgh, Selkirk and Peebles (Mr. David Steel), who said that under the law of Scotland sexual intercourse with a girl under the age of consent was treated as being equivalent to rape, I cannot accept that they are the same at all. I do not think that pregnancy of a girl under the age of 16 should automatically be regarded as a good legal ground for termination. The circumstances here are clearly different. One may perfectly well say, if talking of a girl of, say, 11 or 12 years, that the law says that she is under the age of consent, and, therefore, in a sense this puts it on the same, footing as rape and the victim of rape is not a consenting partner. Nevertheless, we all know that a 15-yearsold girl nowadays is very different from a child. It may have been, as the Prayer Book says, entered into lightly, wantonly and inadvisedly, but nevertheless the girl, if it was not rape, was a consenting party to sexual intercourse unless she was a defective, in which case she is dealt with separately presumed to have some knowledge of the risks and what the implications would be.
