Can the hon. Lady tell the House why, on 28th March, during the election campaign, she wrote a letter to all her constituents saying that she would support the reform of the abortion law on the grounds of the serious risk of a defective child being born, and also on the grounds of incest, or intercourse with a girl under 16? Was this just because it was during the General Election campaign and the hon. Lady wanted to get support from the electors? What is the hon. Lady's real view the one that she has expressed today, or the one which she expressed during her election campaign?
