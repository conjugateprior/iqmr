Interfering with a natural course of pregnancy is something which a doctor does only with great care, knowing full well that he is doing something which could have adverse effects. I should like to quote from the views of one organisation which has a unique contribution to make to discussion of this matter the Royal Medico-Psychological Association. I should declare an interest, because I am a member.
