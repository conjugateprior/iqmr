Some of the Clauses in the Bill are naive. I will not refer to the obvious anomaly within the Clause of rape. Lawyers must look with cynicism at a Clause of this kind, when they consider their own experience. After all, I once defended a man accused of raping six prostitutes. There was nothing physical to show at the end. All he had done was call on a prostitute by himself and produce a weapon and insist that, under duress, she should have intercourse with him. Technically, as the right hon. and learned Member for Warwick and Leamington has pointed out, that would be rape.
