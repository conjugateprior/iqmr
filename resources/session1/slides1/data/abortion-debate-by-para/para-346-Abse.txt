My hon. Friend the Member for Sutton indicated that he thought that the priorities of the Bill were odd. I agree. There is a prissy attitude on the part of the State to planned parenthood something which my hon. Friend the Member for Bebington (Mr. Brooks) hopes to remedy, to some extent, in the Bill which will come before the House later. The prissy attitude that we have adopted means that we are a long way from having within our National Health Service the possibility of everybody having access to the knowledge and guidance necessary for planned parenthood and the stability of family life that goes with it.
