I find it almost impossible to accept paragraph in anything like its present form. I am sure that this will have to be changed in Committee, and I am almost certain that it ought to be taken out. My hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Edgbaston (Mrs. Knight), despite the uproar that it created opposite, was perfectly right, surely, in saying that this is not a problem which ought to be dealt with primarily by the termination of pregnancy. This is, as the hon. Member for Sutton said, a mater which one cannot consider in isolation from current attitudes towards contraception. The terrible social inadequacies in housing and the ignorance and prejudice about contraceptive practices which still persist therein, in the end, lie the solutions.
