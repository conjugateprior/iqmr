I believe that the proposals in this Bill are in keeping with the feeling of the general public and in keeping with the general feelings of the medical profession as a whole. I should like to follow up three points which are raised in the Amendment. First, I take up the point of the independence of the medical profession being jeopardised by these proposals. I listened very carefully to my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Walsall, North (Mr. William Wells) who proposed the Amendment. He spoke at some length about divisions within the medical profession. Certainly divisions there are, in the same way as those of us who support this Bill are divided as to exactly how far we should go, but I believe there is very little difference of opinion among the great majority of doctors in this country that some form of liberalising legislation is necessary. But this division does not touch on the independence of the medical profession.
