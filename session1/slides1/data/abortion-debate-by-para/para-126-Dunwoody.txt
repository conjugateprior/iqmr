The second objection which the Amendment raises is that this Bill does not contain adequate safeguards against the destruction of potentially healthy babies. I think that is basically an emotional argument and, as I said when I intervened earlier, the position under this Bill would be no different from the position now. We have legal abortion in certain circumstances. We also have rather complicated obstetric manoeuvres. happily much less frequently necessary. with modern surgical techniques Caesarean section in particular. Both involve destruction of essentially healthy babies. There is not any change proposed in this Bill in that regard. It is not a situation which any doctor welcomes, but this is the position at the moment and one should recognise that it is not proposed in the Bill to make any change in that regard.
