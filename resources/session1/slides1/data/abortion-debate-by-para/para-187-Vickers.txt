I could not agree less with the hon. and learned Member for Walsall, North. I have opposed the Wolfenden Report on every occasion, especially in connection with the , and I shall go on opposing it as long as I can, but I do not think that the hon. and learned Member was showing a very liberal mind by supporting that Report and refusing to support this Bill. He did not advance any real argument against this Bill, nor did my hon. Friend the Member for Edgbaston. Neither hon. Member has shown that there is no need for a change in the law. I therefore repeat my hope that the Bill will receive a Second Reading, and that it will not be too emasculated in Committee so that it means nothing in the end.
