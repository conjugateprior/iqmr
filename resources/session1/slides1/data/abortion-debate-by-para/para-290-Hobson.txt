On paragraph , I have a great deal of doubt about whether it is right to terminate a pregnancy because the mother is a defective. If, however, the reason is given that there is a strong possibility that the mother being a defective may suffer serious consequences as a result of having the child, why cannot ,he be dealt with under paragraph (a)? If, on the other hand, the reason is the risk that the child itself will be seriously handicapped, then this point is already dealt with under paragraph (b). While I see the arguments, which are quite good, I should have thought that the fact that the mother is a defective will be fully covered by and and this part of paragraph is unnecessary and superfluous.
