I believe it also because it causes many otherwise thoroughly law-abiding citizens to act on the fringe, or perhaps on the wrong side, of the law. As the Minister responsible for law enforcement, I believe that to be a thoroughly bad thing. In addition, there is mounting evidence that public opinion outside is now strongly in favour of a change. I think that there is fairly general agreement I must not put it higher than this on Clause 1(1, ) of the Bill, which allows abortion, subject, of course, to safeguards, where Legislation on these lines would at least give statutory effect to the present case law. How much more it would do would need to be worked out in practice.
