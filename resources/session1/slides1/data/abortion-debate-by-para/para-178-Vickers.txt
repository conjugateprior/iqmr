I hope that we shall make the way easier for the general practitioner, because he now has a rather difficult time. He has to consult a gynecologist, and he cannot be certain who will act for him. He alone has a real knowledge of his patient, and if he is a good general practitioner his patient will have discussed the matter with him, and it is extremely unfortunate that on many occasions he may have to" shop around" to find a gynecologist to help him with his problem.
