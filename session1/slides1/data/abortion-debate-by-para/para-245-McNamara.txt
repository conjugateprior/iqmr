I come now to administration. No one would deny that the present law is flouted, but we are entitled to ask whether the machinery proposed in the Bill would be sufficient. Certainly it contains far less than the Bill introduced in another place by my noble Friend Lord Silkin. It lacks precision of definition, a point to which I shall come later, and it is certainly less strict than the Royal College itself would have it. One must ask why there is reluctance about asking for a consultant's opinion and I agree that there is a technical argument about weight of numbers and so on but one is therefore entitled to ask, the present state of the law being what it is, how many general practitioners have specialist knowledge of abortion in theory. From the state of the law as it is, very few should have it in practice.
