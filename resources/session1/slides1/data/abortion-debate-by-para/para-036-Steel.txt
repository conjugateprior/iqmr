I am told that one of the reasons why illegal abortion still takes place in Sweden is their insistence on a panel rather than leaving it to the decision of two medical men. There is a panel including social workers, psychiatrists and medical practitioners to examine and pass each case. They are behind in their work, and many women are reluctant to appear before a panel of this kind. We have to avoid in the Bill wording which is so restrictive as not to have the effect which we are seeking namely, the ending of the back-street abortions.
