In saying this, I take into full account the speech of my hon. Friend the Member for Kingston upon Hull, North (Mr. McNamara) which, I thought, was an attempt to make all the points extremely fairly and very carefully indeed. When he said," Who are we in this House tto decide?" I paused and thought, but we are not deciding ; we are only making it possible for others to decide. When he went on to say," Who is the mother to decide?" I was not sure that I did not begin to part from him, for I think that the mother has a good deal to do with the decision.
