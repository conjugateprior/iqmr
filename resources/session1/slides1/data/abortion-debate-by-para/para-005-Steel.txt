At a party meeting the other day an avuncular Liberal Peer said that he was very concerned that Mr. David Steel should be introducing this Bill, not because he disagreed with it he was a wholehearted supporter of it but because Mr. Steel was rather young. I suppose that this is a risk which we must run, unless we are prepared to amend our Standing Orders to exclude Members of Parliament under the age of 30 from the Private Members' Ballot and there may be something to be said for that.
