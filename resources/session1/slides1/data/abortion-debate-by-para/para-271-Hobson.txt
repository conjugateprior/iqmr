Therefore, I desire to make it clear that, though I speak from the Dispatch Box, the Opposition do not have a party line of any sort or description in relation to the Bill and it is left to the conscience of hon. Members on these benches, as I believe it is to hon. Members opposite, to vote exactly as they please.
