No one can speak for a whole profession, least of all the medical profession ; which contains so many different strands of opinion, different thoughts and religious beliefs. I would not wish to do so. I should like, however, to tell the House something of the experience of someone who has had cases referred to him for a psychiatric opinion on abortion. In particular, I should like to draw the attention of the House to Clause (1, ), which is the main strength of the Bill and, naturally, its most contentious portion.
