THIS WILL BE THE LAST ELECTION OF THIS CENTURY. AND ONE
                   OF ITS MOST IMPORTANT. WE HAVE DUCKED THE CHALLENGES
                   THAT CONFRONT OUR COUNTRY FOR TOO LONG. IT IS TIME TO
                   FACE THEM. THE CHOICE YOU MAKE WILL SHAPE BRITAIN'S
                   FUTURE FOR THE NEXT 50 YEARS.

                   THERE ARE NO QUICK FIXES, NO INSTANT SOLUTIONS. EIGHTEEN
                   YEARS OF CONSERVATIVE GOVERNMENT HAVE LEFT OUR SOCIETY
                   DIVIDED, OUR PUBLIC SERVICES RUN DOWN, OUR SENSE OF
                   COMMUNITY FRACTURED AND OUR ECONOMY UNDER-PERFORMING.
                   THERE IS MUCH TO BE DONE TO PREPARE BRITAIN FOR THE NEXT
                   CENTURY AND NO TIME TO WASTE IN GETTING STARTED.

                   YET A TERRIBLE FATALISM SEEMS TO GRIP POLITICIANS.
                   THOUGH THE CHALLENGES ARE IMMENSE, THE SOLUTIONS WE ARE
                   OFFERED ARE ALL TOO OFTEN PUNY. WE ARE TOLD WE CAN'T ASK
                   PEOPLE TO PAY MORE FOR A BETTER EDUCATION. OR CHANGE THE
                   WAY WE LIVE TO PROTECT OUR ENVIRONMENT. OR SHARE MORE TO
                   GIVE BETTER OPPORTUNITIES TO THOSE WHO HAVE LESS. OR
                   MODERNISE OUR POLITICS TO GIVE PEOPLE MORE SAY.

                   THE LIBERAL DEMOCRATS REJECT THIS TIMIDITY.

                   WE ARE IN POLITICS NOT JUST TO MANAGE THINGS BETTER, BUT
                   TO MAKE THINGS HAPPEN. TO BUILD A MORE PROSPEROUS, FAIR
                   AND OPEN SOCIETY. WE BELIEVE IN THE MARKET ECONOMY AS
                   THE BEST WAY TO DELIVER PROSPERITY AND DISTRIBUTE
                   ECONOMIC BENEFITS. BUT WE RECOGNISE THAT MARKET
                   MECHANISMS ON THEIR OWN ARE NOT ENOUGH; THAT THE PRIVATE
                   SECTOR ALONE CANNOT ENSURE THAT THERE ARE GOOD SERVICES
                   FOR EVERYONE, OR PROMOTE EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITIES, OR
                   TACKLE ECONOMIC INEQUALITY, OR PROTECT THE ENVIRONMENT
                   FOR FUTURE GENERATIONS.

                   WE BELIEVE IN A SOCIETY IN WHICH EVERY CITIZEN SHARES
                   RIGHTS AND RESPONSIBILITIES. BUT, WE RECOGNISE THAT A
                   STRONG COUNTRY IS BUILT FROM THE BOTTOM, NOT THE TOP;
                   THAT CONFORMITY QUICKLY BECOMES THE ENEMY OF DIVERSITY.
                   AND THAT THE IMPOSITION OF SOCIAL BLUEPRINTS LEADS TO
                   AUTHORITARIAN CENTRALISED GOVERNMENT. LIBERAL DEMOCRATS
                   BELIEVE THAT POWER AND OPPORTUNITY, LIKE WEALTH, SHOULD
                   BE WIDELY SPREAD.

                   ABOVE ALL, LIBERAL DEMOCRACY IS ABOUT LIBERTY. THAT DOES
                   NOT JUST MEAN FREEDOM FROM OPPRESSIVE GOVERNMENT. IT
                   MEANS PROVIDING ALL CITIZENS WITH THE OPPORTUNITY TO
                   BUILD WORTHWHILE LIVES FOR THEMSELVES AND THEIR FAMILIES
                   AND HELPING THEM TO RECOGNISE THEIR RESPONSIBILITIES TO
                   THE WIDER COMMUNITY.

                   LIBERAL DEMOCRATS BELIEVE THE ROLE OF DEMOCRATIC
                   GOVERNMENT IS TO PROTECT AND STRENGTHEN LIBERTY, TO
                   REDRESS THE BALANCE BETWEEN THE POWERFUL AND THE WEAK,
                   BETWEEN RICH AND POOR AND BETWEEN IMMEDIATE GAINS AND
                   LONG-TERM ENVIRONMENTAL COSTS.

                   THAT IS THE LIBERAL DEMOCRAT VISION: OF ACTIVE
                   GOVERNMENT WHICH INVESTS IN PEOPLE, PROMOTES THEIR
                   LONG-TERM PROSPERITY AND WELFARE, SAFEGUARDS THEIR
                   SECURITY, AND IS ANSWERABLE TO THEM FOR ITS ACTIONS.

                   MUCH OF WHAT WE PROPOSE HERE REQUIRES NO MONEY - ONLY
                   POLITICAL WILL. BUT WHERE EXTRA INVESTMENT IS REQUIRED
                   WE SAY WHERE IT WILL COME FROM. THIS IS A MENU WITH
                   PRICES.

                   THE PURPOSE OF THIS MANIFESTO IS TO WIDEN OPPORTUNITIES
                   FOR ALL.

                   AND ITS AIM IS TO BUILD A NATION OF SELF-RELIANT
                   INDIVIDUALS, LIVING IN STRONG COMMUNITIES, BACKED BY AN
                   ENABLING GOVERNMENT.

OUR AIM: TO MAKE BRITAIN THE WORLD'S FOREMOST LEARNING
                    SOCIETY BY 2010.

                    THE PROBLEM: THIS COUNTRY'S EDUCATION HAS BEEN UNDERFUNDED
                    AND UNDERMINED BY REPEATED SHIFTS IN POLICY. STANDARDS ARE
                    TOO LOW, ESPECIALLY IN CORE SKILLS SUCH AS READING AND
                    MATHS. BRITAIN IS TOO LOW IN THE WORLD LEAGUE TABLES.

                    OUR COMMITMENT: LIBERAL DEMOCRATS WILL MAKE EDUCATION THE
                    NEXT GOVERNMENT'S TOP PRIORITY. WE WILL INVEST AN
                    ADDITIONAL £2 BILLION PER YEAR IN EDUCATION, FUNDED BY AN
                    EXTRA 1P IN THE POUND ON THE BASIC RATE OF INCOME TAX.

                    
                   OUR FIRST PRIORITY IS TO:

                      * GIVE CHILDREN THE BEST START BY PROVIDING HIGH QUALITY
                        EARLY YEARS EDUCATION FOR EVERY 3 AND 4 YEAR-OLD CHILD
                        WHOSE PARENTS WANT IT.

                   KEY PRIORITIES ARE TO:

                      * INCREASE FUNDING FOR BOOKS AND EQUIPMENT IN SCHOOLS. IN
                        THE FIRST YEAR, WE WILL DOUBLE SPENDING ON BOOKS AND
                        EQUIPMENT TO OVERCOME THE EFFECT OF RECENT CUTS.
                      * REDUCE PRIMARY SCHOOL CLASS SIZES SO THAT WITHIN 5 YEARS
                        NO CHILD BETWEEN 5 AND 11 WILL NEED TO BE IN A CLASS OF
                        MORE THAN 30.
                      * TACKLE THE BACKLOG OF REPAIR AND MAINTENANCE TO 
BUILDINGS
                        WITH £500M ADDITIONAL INVESTMENT OVER 5 YEARS.
                      * BOOST CHANCES FOR ALL ADULTS TO IMPROVE THEIR SKILLS AND
                        GET BETTER QUALIFICATIONS.

                   MAKING THE BEST START
                   EARLY YEARS EDUCATION IS THE ESSENTIAL BUILDING BLOCK FOR
                   HIGHER STANDARDS AND ACHIEVEMENT LATER ON. EVERY £1 SPENT ON
                   HIGH QUALITY UNDER-FIVES EDUCATION RAISES STANDARDS IN LATER
                   LIFE AND ADDS UP TO £7 OF VALUE TO THE NATION'S ECONOMY. WE
                   WILL:

                      * GIVE CHILDREN THE BEST START BY PROVIDING HIGH QUALITY
                        EARLY YEARS EDUCATION FOR EVERY 3 AND 4 YEAR-OLD CHILD
                        WHOSE PARENTS WANT IT. THIS WILL BE THE FIRST CALL ON 
OUR
                        £2 BILLION ANNUAL PROGRAMME OF EXTRA INVESTMENT IN
                        EDUCATION.
                      * PROMOTE HIGH STANDARDS IN EARLY YEARS EDUCATION. WE WILL
                        SET MINIMUM STANDARDS FOR CARE, CURRICULUM AND PREMISES.
                        WE WILL ENSURE THAT THOSE IN EARLY YEARS EDUCATION ARE
                        SUPERVISED BY QUALIFIED STAFF.
                      * PROVIDE CHOICE IN EARLY YEARS EDUCATION. WE WILL SCRAP
                        THE BUREAUCRATIC VOUCHER SCHEME. WE WILL ENSURE A 
VARIETY
                        OF PROVISION FROM A WIDE RANGE OF PUBLIC, PRIVATE AND
                        VOLUNTARY PROVIDERS.
                      * RAISING STANDARDS IN SCHOOLS. WE WILL RAISE STANDARDS IN
                        SCHOOLS, ESPECIALLY IN LITERACY AND NUMERACY, WHICH ARE
                        STILL FAR TOO LOW.

                   WE WILL:

                      * IMPROVE TEACHING STANDARDS. WE WILL SET UP A GENERAL
                        TEACHING COUNCIL, CHARGED WITH IMPROVING TEACHING
                        STANDARDS AND MAKING TEACHING A PROFESSION TO BE PROUD 
OF
                        AGAIN. WE WILL PROVIDE MORE OPPORTUNITIES FOR
                        PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT AND REWARD EXCELLENCE IN
                        TEACHING. WE WILL HELP POOR TEACHERS IMPROVE, BUT IF 
THEY
                        CANNOT, WE WILL ENSURE THEY DO NOT CONTINUE TO TEACH.
                      * ENCOURAGE SCHOOLS TO SUCCEED. WE WILL STRENGTHEN THE
                        INSPECTION SYSTEM SO THAT IT HELPS SCHOOLS AND WE WILL
                        EXTEND INSPECTION TO MONITORING LOCAL EDUCATION
                        AUTHORITIES (LEAS).
                      * STRENGTHEN DISCIPLINE IN SCHOOLS. WE WILL SUPPORT
                        TEACHERS IN MAINTAINING DISCIPLINE AND PROVIDE THEM WITH
                        THE MEANS TO DO SO - FOR EXAMPLE, BY PROVIDING BETTER
                        ACCESS TO SPECIAL REFERRAL UNITS. WE WILL REQUIRE EVERY
                        SCHOOL TO DEVELOP A POLICY TO TACKLE BULLYING AND
                        TRUANCY. WE WILL LAUNCH A NATIONAL TRUANCY WATCH SCHEME.
                        WE WILL OBLIGE LEAS TO FULFIL THEIR RESPONSIBILITIES TO
                        EDUCATE PUPILS EXCLUDED OR SUSPENDED FROM SCHOOL.
                      * MEASURE ACHIEVEMENT IN PUPILS AND SCHOOLS. WE WILL GIVE
                        EVERY PUPIL A PERSONAL RECORD OF ACHIEVEMENT WHICH WILL
                        ENABLE THEM TO BUILD UP A SET OF NATIONALLY ACCREDITED
                        QUALIFICATIONS AND RECORD THEIR OTHER ACHIEVEMENTS. WE
                        WILL REQUIRE SCHOOLS TO PUBLISH MEANINGFUL INFORMATION 
ON
                        THEIR STANDARDS, ACHIEVEMENTS AND PLANS FOR THE FUTURE.
                      * IMPROVE THE NATIONAL CURRICULUM. WE WILL REPLACE THE
                        NATIONAL CURRICULUM WITH A MORE FOCUSED AND FLEXIBLE
                        MINIMUM CURRICULUM ENTITLEMENT. WE WILL ENSURE THAT
                        RELIGIOUS EDUCATION PROVIDES PUPILS WITH AN 
UNDERSTANDING
                        OF THE MAJOR TRADITIONS OF BELIEF IN THIS COUNTRY.
                      * BOOST LITERACY. WE WILL ESTABLISH SPECIAL LITERACY
                        PROGRAMMES INVOLVING PARENTS WITH TEACHERS IN A DRIVE TO
                        ENSURE THAT 90 PER CENT OF ALL PUPILS REACH THEIR
                        EXPECTED READING AGE BY 2005.

                   INVESTING IN SCHOOLS                                   
[IMAGE]
                   EXTRA INVESTMENT FOR WELL-EQUIPPED CLASSROOMS AND
                   BETTER-MAINTAINED BUILDINGS IS ESSENTIAL IF STANDARDS ARE TO
                   IMPROVE.

                   WE WILL:

                      * INCREASE FUNDING FOR BOOKS AND EQUIPMENT IN SCHOOLS. IN
                        THE FIRST YEAR, WE WILL DOUBLE SPENDING ON BOOKS AND
                        EQUIPMENT TO OVERCOME THE EFFECT OF RECENT CUTS. A
                        TYPICAL PRIMARY SCHOOL OF 250 PUPILS WILL GET AN EXTRA
                        £16,000. A TYPICAL SECONDARY SCHOOL OF 1,000 PUPILS WILL
                        GET AN EXTRA £110,000.
                      * REDUCE PRIMARY SCHOOL CLASS SIZES SO THAT WITHIN 5 YEARS
                        NO CHILD BETWEEN 5 AND 11 WILL NEED TO BE IN A CLASS OF
                        MORE THAN 30.
                      * TACKLE THE BACKLOG OF REPAIRS. WE WILL INVEST AN
                        ADDITIONAL £500 MILLION OVER 5 YEARS IN REPAIRING
                        CRUMBLING AND UNSAFE BUILDINGS.
                      * SUPPORT CHILDREN WITH SPECIAL NEEDS. WE WILL FULLY FUND
                        THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE CODE OF PRACTICE FOR SPECIAL
                        EDUCATIONAL NEEDS.

                   A NEW PARTNERSHIP FOR SCHOOLS
                   INVOLVING PARENTS IN THE EDUCATION OF THEIR CHILDREN AND
                   ENSURING SCHOOLS ARE SUPPORTED BY LOCAL COMMUNITIES ARE BOTH
                   ESSENTIAL TO ACHIEVING HIGHER STANDARDS AND A BETTER USE OF
                   RESOURCES.

                   WE WILL:

                      * INCREASE THE ROLE OF PARENTS IN EDUCATION. WE WILL 
EXTEND
                        HOME/SCHOOL/PUPIL LINKS, DEVELOP HOME-SCHOOL PARTNERSHIP
                        ARRANGEMENTS AND SUPPORT PARENTS WITH INFORMATION AND
                        RESOURCES TO HELP THEM HELP THEIR CHILD. WE WILL REQUIRE
                        THE SCHOOLS INSPECTION SERVICE TO REPORT ON HOME-SCHOOL
                        PARTNERSHIPS AS PART OF SCHOOL INSPECTIONS. WE WILL
                        PROMOTE SCHOOL COUNCILS AND GUARANTEE AUTOMATIC
                        REPRESENTATION ON GOVERNING BODIES TO STAFF AND, WHERE
                        APPROPRIATE, STUDENTS.
                      * OPEN UP SCHOOLS TO THE WHOLE COMMUNITY. WE WILL 
ENCOURAGE
                        SCHOOLS TO DEVELOP COURSES FOR PARENTS, BUILD LINKS WITH
                        LOCAL LEISURE ORGANISATIONS TO OPEN UP SCHOOL SPORTS
                        FACILITIES TO THE COMMUNITY AND WORK WITH LOCAL
                        BUSINESSES TO PROVIDE IMPROVED COMPUTER EDUCATION.
                      * GIVE ALL SCHOOLS MORE INDEPENDENCE AND ALLOW THEM TO
                        DEVELOP THEIR OWN STYLES AND STRENGTHS. WE WILL DEVOLVE
                        AS MANY POWERS AS POSSIBLE TO SCHOOLS AND GIVE THEM MORE
                        CONTROL OVER THEIR BUDGETS. WE WILL MAKE NEW 'LIGHT
                        TOUCH' LEAS RESPONSIBLE FOR THOSE FUNCTIONS THAT CANNOT
                        BE UNDERTAKEN BY INDIVIDUAL SCHOOLS ON THEIR OWN, SUCH 
AS
                        COORDINATION, PLANNING AND MONITORING STANDARDS. WE WILL
                        BRING GRANT-MAINTAINED SCHOOLS AND CITY TECHNOLOGY
                        COLLEGES INTO THIS NEW FRAMEWORK AND SCRAP THE FUNDING
                        AGENCY FOR SCHOOLS. LIBERAL DEMOCRATS ARE OPPOSED TO
                        SELECTION, BUT BELIEVE THAT DECISIONS ON THIS SHOULD BE
                        MADE BY LOCAL COMMUNITIES THROUGH THEIR LOCAL COUNCILS
                        AND NOT BY POLITICIANS AT WESTMINSTER.
                      * RECOGNISE THE VALUABLE ROLE OF CHURCH SCHOOLS IN THE
                        MAINTAINED SECTOR. WE WILL INITIATE A DIALOGUE WITH ALL
                        THE MAJOR FAITHS ABOUT THE ROLE THEY WISH TO PLAY IN
                        EDUCATION IN THE FUTURE. WHERE ANY OF THE MAJOR FAITHS
                        WISH TO ESTABLISH PUBLICLY FUNDED VOLUNTARY SCHOOLS WE
                        WILL ENABLE THEM TO DO SO, PROVIDED THAT THEY ENJOY
                        SUBSTANTIAL COMMUNITY SUPPORT, OFFER ACCEPTABLE
                        PROGRAMMES OF STUDY, PROVIDE EQUALITY OF OPPORTUNITY AND
                        ARE ABLE TO DELIVER THE MINIMUM CURRICULUM ENTITLEMENT.
                      * FORGE A NEW PARTNERSHIP WITH THE INDEPENDENT SECTOR. WE
                        WILL ENCOURAGE INDEPENDENT SCHOOLS TO WORK WITH STATE
                        SCHOOLS. WE WILL PHASE OUT THE ASSISTED PLACES SCHEME 
AND
                        USE THE MONEY SAVED TO ENABLE LEAS, IF THEY WISH, TO
                        ENTER INTO LOCAL PARTNERSHIP SCHEMES. THESE COULD 
INCLUDE
                        ASSISTING THE FUNDING OF PUPILS AT INDEPENDENT SCHOOLS.
                        PUPILS CURRENTLY COVERED BY THE ASSISTED PLACES SCHEME
                        WOULD, HOWEVER, BE PROTECTED UNTIL THEY FINISH THEIR
                        STUDIES. WE WILL REQUIRE INDEPENDENT SCHOOLS TO OFFER 
THE
                        MINIMUM CURRICULUM ENTITLEMENT. WE WILL EXTEND 
CHARITABLE
                        STATUS TO ALL SCHOOLS WITHOUT AFFECTING TOTAL COUNCIL
                        FUNDING AND MAINTAIN THE VAT EXEMPTION ON SCHOOL FEES.

                   EXTENDING LIFE-LONG LEARNING
                   IN THE INFORMATION AGE, EDUCATION MUST BE A LIFE-LONG 
ACTIVITY
                   FROM WHICH PEOPLE CAN BENEFIT ANYWHERE AND AT ANY TIME, 
RATHER
                   THAN BEING SOMETHING THAT ONLY HAPPENS IN SCHOOL.

                   WE WILL:

                      * WIDEN ACCESS TO FURTHER EDUCATION. WE WILL GIVE EVERY
                        PERSON AN INDIVIDUAL LEARNING ACCOUNT AS THE BASIS FOR
                        LIFE-LONG POST-SCHOOL EDUCATION WITH CONTRIBUTIONS MADE
                        BY THE STATE, INDIVIDUALS AND EMPLOYERS. OUR AIM IS THAT
                        THE STATE CONTRIBUTION WILL BE AT LEAST EQUIVALENT TO 
THE
                        COST OF FEES ON APPROVED COURSES. WE WILL REPLACE THE
                        STUDENT LOANS SCHEME WITH A FAIR REPAYMENT SCHEME LINKED
                        TO SALARIES IN LATER LIFE. WE OPPOSE TOP-UP FEES FOR
                        TUITION. OUR AIM IS TO ENSURE THAT STUDENTS ON APPROVED
                        COURSES (INCLUDING PART-TIME COURSES) UP TO FIRST DEGREE
                        LEVEL ARE TREATED EQUALLY.
                      * PROMOTE FLEXIBLE LEARNING. WE WILL CREATE A HIGHER
                        STANDARD CREDIT-BASED SYSTEM FOR ALL POST-14 COURSES,
                        INCLUDING THE CURRENT A-LEVELS AND DEGREE COURSES. WE
                        WILL WORK WITH THE PRIVATE SECTOR TO LINK ALL SCHOOLS TO
                        THE INFORMATION SUPER HIGHWAY AND ENSURE THAT THEY HAVE
                        THE EQUIPMENT AND SKILLS TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THIS.
                      * PROMOTE TRAINING IN THE WORKPLACE. TO SUPPORT COMPANIES
                        THAT INVEST IN EDUCATION AND TRAINING, AND TO ENCOURAGE
                        OTHERS TO DO SO, WE WILL INTRODUCE A 2 PER CENT
                        REMISSIBLE LEVY ON COMPANY PAYROLLS. THIS WOULD BE
                        DEDUCTIBLE AGAINST THE COST OF PROVIDING ACCREDITED
                        TRAINING OR MAKING CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE INDIVIDUAL
                        LEARNING ACCOUNT. SMALL BUSINESSES WILL BE EXEMPT. WE
                        WILL GIVE TRAINING AND ENTERPRISE COUNCILS THE LEADING
                        ROLE IN FORGING LOCAL PARTNERSHIPS TO MEET YOUTH 
TRAINING
                        AND EMPLOYMENT NEEDS.
                      * EXPAND TRAINING OPPORTUNITIES FOR YOUNG PEOPLE. OUR AIM
                        IS TO ENSURE THAT 16-19 YEAR-OLDS RECEIVE THE EQUIVALENT
                        OF AT LEAST 2 DAYS A WEEK EDUCATION OR ON-THE-JOB
                        TRAINING.
                      * BOOST CHANCES FOR ALL ADULTS TO IMPROVE THEIR SKILLS AND
                        GET BETTER QUALIFICATIONS. WE WILL ENSURE THAT ALL 
ADULTS
                        ON APPROVED COURSES OR TRAINING HAVE ACCESS TO FINANCIAL
                        SUPPORT, EITHER THROUGH THEIR INDIVIDUAL LEARNING
                        ACCOUNTS OR FROM THEIR EMPLOYER USING OUR NEW REMISSIBLE
                        TRAINING LEVY.
                      * IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF TERTIARY COURSES. WE WILL CREATE 
A
                        NEW QUALITY COUNCIL TO ENSURE HIGH STANDARDS AND VALUE
                        FOR MONEY IN ALL POST-16 EDUCATION AND TRAINING COURSES.
                      * SECURE ACADEMIC FREEDOM. WE WILL ENSURE THE FUNDING OF
                        UNIVERSITY TEACHING AND RESEARCH, SAFEGUARD ACADEMIC
                        FREEDOM AND STANDARDS.

OUR AIM: TO END THE CYCLE OF BOOM AND BUST AND EQUIP
                    BRITAIN'S ECONOMY TO COMPETE IN THE GLOBAL MARKET-PLACE.

                    THE PROBLEM: DESPITE THE CURRENT PRE-ELECTION MINI-BOOM,
                    THE FUNDAMENTALS OF BRITAIN'S ECONOMY REMAIN WEAK. WE
                    CONTINUE TO BE HELD BACK BY INSTABILITY IN ECONOMIC
                    MANAGEMENT, AN UNDERSKILLED LABOUR FORCE AND CHRONIC
                    UNDER-INVESTMENT. BRITAIN CONTINUES TO CONSUME TOO MUCH AND
                    INVEST TOO LITTLE.

                    OUR COMMITMENT: LIBERAL DEMOCRATS WILL LOCK IN ECONOMIC
                    STABILITY, ENCOURAGE SAVING AND PROMOTE ENTERPRISE. WE WILL
                    RAISE THE QUALITY OF BRITAIN'S WORKFORCE THROUGH ADDITIONAL
                    INVESTMENT IN EDUCATION AND TRAINING. AS PART OF OUR
                    STRATEGY TO BUILD A SUSTAINABLE ECONOMY, WE WILL SHIFT THE
                    BURDEN OF TAXATION FROM EMPLOYMENT TO THE DEPLETION OF
                    NATURAL RESOURCES.

                    
                   OUR PRIORITIES ARE TO:

                      * PROVIDE STABILITY IN ECONOMIC MANAGEMENT TO ENCOURAGE
                        LONG-TERM INVESTMENT.
                      * RAISE THE QUALITY OF BRITAIN'S WORKFORCE AND GET PEOPLE
                        BACK TO WORK.
                      * PROMOTE ENTERPRISE AND SMALL BUSINESSES.
                      * BEGIN TO SHIFT TAXATION FROM JOBS, WEALTH AND GOODS TO
                        POLLUTION AND THE DEPLETION OF NATURAL RESOURCES.

                   INVESTING IN BRITAIN'S FUTURE
                   LONG-TERM INVESTMENT AND ECONOMIC STABILITY ARE CRUCIAL TO
                   FUTURE ECONOMIC SUCCESS.

                   WE WILL:

                      * SECURE STABLE PRICES AND LOW INTEREST RATES. WE WILL 
TURN
                        THE BANK OF ENGLAND INTO A UK RESERVE BANK, FREE FROM
                        POLITICAL INTERFERENCE. WE WILL CHARGE THE BANK WITH
                        KEEPING INFLATION LOW AND MAKE IT ACCOUNTABLE TO
                        PARLIAMENT FOR ACHIEVING THIS GOAL. LOWER INFLATION AND
                        GREATER EXCHANGE RATE STABILITY CAN BE BETTER SECURED BY
                        WORKING WITH BRITAIN'S EUROPEAN PARTNERS. THE BEST
                        FRAMEWORK FOR THIS IS A SINGLE EUROPEAN CURRENCY AND IT
                        IS IN BRITAIN'S INTERESTS TO TAKE PART IN THIS. HOWEVER,
                        THREE CONDITIONS MUST BE MET BEFORE THIS CAN HAPPEN.
                        FIRST, THE SINGLE CURRENCY MUST BE FIRMLY FOUNDED ON THE
                        MAASTRICHT CRITERIA. SECOND, BRITAIN MUST MEET THOSE
                        CRITERIA. THIRD, THE BRITISH PEOPLE MUST HAVE SAID 'YES'
                        IN A REFERENDUM. IF THESE CONDITIONS FOR A SINGLE
                        CURRENCY ARE IN PLACE, BRITAIN SHOULD JOIN.
                      * ENSURE RESPONSIBLE ECONOMIC MANAGEMENT. WE WILL KEEP TO
                        THE 'GOLDEN RULE' OF PUBLIC FINANCE: OVER THE ECONOMIC
                        CYCLE, TOTAL BORROWING SHOULD NOT EXCEED TOTAL
                        INVESTMENT. WE WILL MAKE THE GOVERNMENT ACCOUNTABLE TO
                        PARLIAMENT FOR KEEPING TO THIS RULE, AND SUBJECT IT TO
                        INDEPENDENT MONITORING. WE WILL CUT WASTEFUL SPENDING 
AND
                        ENSURE NEW SPENDING DELIVERS VALUE FOR MONEY.
                      * BUILD UP BRITAIN'S CAPITAL ASSETS. WE WILL DISTINGUISH
                        BETWEEN CAPITAL AND CURRENT SPENDING IN THE NATIONAL
                        ACCOUNTING SYSTEM. WE WILL PROMOTE EFFECTIVE
                        PUBLIC/PRIVATE INVESTMENT PARTNERSHIPS AT BOTH NATIONAL
                        AND LOCAL LEVELS, WITH COUNCILS' BORROWING CAREFULLY
                        CONTROLLED.
                      * PUT BRITAIN'S PEOPLE BACK TO WORK. WE WILL ENABLE
                        LONG-TERM UNEMPLOYED PEOPLE TO TURN THEIR UNEMPLOYMENT
                        BENEFITS INTO 'WORKING BENEFITS' PAID TO AN EMPLOYER TO
                        RECRUIT AND TRAIN THEM. WE WILL BREAK OPEN THE POVERTY
                        TRAPS THAT STOP UNEMPLOYED PEOPLE FROM WORKING. OUR 
PLANS
                        FOR BOOSTING INVESTMENT IN INFRASTRUCTURE, PROMOTING
                        SMALL BUSINESSES AND ENCOURAGING ENERGY CONSERVATION 
WILL
                        CREATE HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF NEW JOBS.
                      * INVEST IN A HIGHLY-SKILLED WORKFORCE. OUR INVESTMENT OF
                        AN ADDITIONAL £2 BILLION A YEAR IN EDUCATION AND 
TRAINING
                        WILL IMPROVE SKILLS AND INCREASE THE NATION'S KNOWLEDGE
                        BASE.
                      * PROMOTE ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY. WE WILL BEGIN A
                        LONG-TERM SHIFT IN TAXATION, REDUCING TAXES ON JOBS,
                        WEALTH AND GOODS AND SHIFTING THEM TO POLLUTION AND
                        RESOURCE DEPLETION. WE WILL USE NEW NATIONAL INDICATORS
                        OF PROGRESS WHICH INCLUDE MEASURES OF QUALITY OF LIFE 
AND
                        ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY.
                      * ENCOURAGE PEOPLE TO SAVE. OUR AIM IS TO EXTEND THE
                        ADVANTAGES OF TESSAS AND PEPS TO A WIDER RANGE OF SAVERS
                        BY DEVELOPING A NEW SAVE-AS-YOU-EARN SCHEME. WE WILL
                        ENCOURAGE PERSONAL AND PORTABLE PENSION PLANS.

                   INVESTING IN ENTERPRISE
                   SMALL BUSINESS, ENTERPRISE AND SELF-EMPLOYMENT ARE THE ENGINE
                   OF A MODERN DYNAMIC ECONOMY AND A VITAL SOURCE OF NEW JOBS 
AND
                   GROWTH.

                   WE WILL:

                      * SUPPORT SMALL AND MEDIUM-SIZED BUSINESSES. WE WILL
                        ENCOURAGE THE BANKS TO DEVELOP NEW SOURCES OF PRIVATE
                        FINANCE, INCLUDING GRANTS, EQUITY FINANCE AND MUTUAL
                        GUARANTEE SCHEMES. WE WILL SEEK TO EXPAND THE SOURCES OF
                        'SEED-CORN' CAPITAL. WE WILL LEGISLATE FOR A STATUTORY
                        RIGHT TO INTEREST ON LATE DEBT PAYMENTS. WE WILL REQUIRE
                        THE BANKS TO DEVELOP NEW CODES OF BANKING PRACTICE FOR
                        SMALL BUSINESSES. WE WILL CUT RED TAPE, FOR EXAMPLE BY
                        STOPPING EUROPEAN INSTITUTIONS INTERFERING WHERE THEY
                        SHOULDN'T AND BY PREVENTING WHITEHALL DEPARTMENTS
                        'GOLD-PLATING' EUROPEAN REGULATIONS WITH EXTRA RULES. WE
                        WILL, IN THE LONG-TERM, ABOLISH THE UNIFORM BUSINESS 
RATE
                        AND BRING IN A NEW, FAIRER LOCAL RATING SYSTEM. WE WILL
                        ENSURE THAT GOVERNMENT PURCHASING GIVES SPECIAL EMPHASIS
                        AND EASIER ACCESS TO SMALL AND MEDIUM-SIZED FIRMS.
                      * BOOST REGIONAL AND LOCAL ECONOMIES. WE WILL SET UP
                        REGIONALLY-BASED DEVELOPMENT AGENCIES TO BUILD NEW
                        PARTNERSHIPS BETWEEN SMALL BUSINESSES, LOCAL COUNCILS,
                        BUSINESS LINKS, TECS AND LOCAL CHAMBERS OF COMMERCE. WE
                        WILL ENCOURAGE THESE BODIES TO COME TOGETHER TO PROVIDE
                        'ONE-STOP SHOPS'. WE WILL ENABLE COUNCILS TO RAISE
                        CAPITAL FOR LOCAL INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENT, WHERE THEY
                        WORK IN PARTNERSHIP WITH THE PRIVATE SECTOR. WE WILL
                        ENCOURAGE INDUSTRIAL DEVELOPMENT BY PROMOTING
                        GEOGRAPHICAL CENTRES OF INDUSTRIAL EXCELLENCE.
                      * INVEST IN RESEARCH AND INNOVATION. WE WILL EXPAND 
SUPPORT
                        FOR SCIENCE AND RESEARCH BY SHIFTING GOVERNMENT FUNDS
                        AWAY FROM MILITARY RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT AND INTO
                        CIVIL SCIENCE AND RESEARCH, AND IMPROVE SPECIALIST
                        RESEARCH FACILITIES FOR INDUSTRY. WE WILL ENCOURAGE
                        REGIONAL TECHNOLOGY TRANSFER CENTRES TO BRING TOGETHER
                        THE RESOURCES OF INDUSTRY, UNIVERSITIES AND GOVERNMENT
                        LABORATORIES.
                      * PROMOTE TOURISM. WE WILL BRING TOGETHER THE MARKETING 
AND
                        INFRASTRUCTURE WORK OF GOVERNMENT, LOCAL COUNCILS AND
                        TOURIST BOARDS. WE WILL ENSURE THAT LOCAL COMMUNITIES 
ARE
                        INVOLVED IN THE PLANNING OF TOURIST DEVELOPMENTS FROM 
THE
                        EARLIEST STAGES.
                      * BUILD NEW PARTNERSHIPS AT WORK. WE WILL GIVE EMPLOYEES
                        NEW RIGHTS TO CONSULTATION AND PARTICIPATION IN 
DECISIONS
                        AND GIVE COMPANIES AND THEIR EMPLOYEES ACCESS TO ADVICE
                        ON THE FORMS OF PARTNERSHIP WHICH BEST SUIT THEM. WE 
WILL
                        PROMOTE PROFIT-SHARING, MUTUAL STRUCTURES AND EMPLOYEE
                        SHARE-OWNERSHIP SCHEMES. WE WILL EXTEND THE BENEFITS OF
                        THE SOCIAL CHAPTER OF THE MAASTRICHT TREATY TO ALL UK
                        EMPLOYEES, WHILE RESISTING THE ADOPTION OF NEW RULES 
THAT
                        UNNECESSARILY HARM JOB OPPORTUNITIES.
                      * ENCOURAGE A CULTURE OF LONG-TERM BUSINESS INVESTMENT. WE
                        WILL REQUIRE COMPANIES TO PUBLISH INFORMATION ON THEIR
                        LONG-TERM INVESTMENT ACHIEVEMENTS, INCLUDING
                        ENVIRONMENTAL PERFORMANCE, RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT, AND
                        TRAINING. WE WILL INTRODUCE GREATER SHAREHOLDER CONTROL
                        OVER DIRECTORS' PAY AND APPOINTMENTS.
                      * PROMOTE BRITISH EXPORTS. WE WILL MAKE EXPORT PROMOTION
                        AND COMMERCIAL ACTIVITY A HIGHER PRIORITY FOR BRITISH
                        EMBASSIES.

                   MAKING BRITAIN MORE COMPETITIVE
                   A COMPETITIVE DOMESTIC ECONOMY IS ESSENTIAL IF BRITISH
                   COMPANIES ARE TO SUCCEED IN THE GLOBAL MARKET.

                   WE WILL:

                      * STRENGTHEN THE LAW ON COMPETITION. WE WILL TIGHTEN THE
                        RULES ON MONOPOLIES AND ADOPT A PRO-COMPETITION STANCE 
ON
                        TAKE-OVERS AND MERGERS. WE WILL COMBINE THE MONOPOLIES
                        AND MERGERS COMMISSION AND THE OFFICE OF FAIR TRADING
                        INTO A SINGLE POWERFUL BODY, INDEPENDENT OF GOVERNMENT
                        AND CHARGED WITH PROMOTING COMPETITION.
                      * GIVE CONSUMERS MORE POWER. WE WILL PROMOTE THE
                        ESTABLISHMENT OF INDUSTRY-WIDE OMBUDSMEN SCHEMES TO
                        IMPROVE COMPLAINTS PROCEDURES AND CONSUMER REDRESS. WE
                        WILL STRENGTHEN CUSTOMER GUARANTEES, IMPROVE PRODUCT
                        STANDARDS AND LABELLING, ESPECIALLY FOR ENVIRONMENTAL
                        PURPOSES, AND ENCOURAGE PRODUCTS THAT ARE EASIER TO
                        REPAIR, REUSE AND RECYCLE. WE WILL INSIST ON CLEAR
                        LABELLING FOR FOOD PRODUCTS WHICH INCLUDE GENETICALLY
                        MODIFIED INGREDIENTS.
                      * REFORM THE PRIVATISED UTILITIES. WE WILL COMBINE THE
                        EXISTING REGULATORS INTO A SINGLE OFFICE OF UTILITY
                        REGULATION, REPORTING TO A CABINET MINISTER RESPONSIBLE
                        FOR CONSUMER AFFAIRS. THIS NEW OFFICE WILL CONTAIN A
                        REGULATORY BOARD FOR EACH INDUSTRY AND WILL BE CHARGED
                        WITH PROTECTING THE CONSUMER AND ENSURING THAT EXCESS
                        PROFITS ARE USED TO REDUCE PRICES AND INCREASE 
INVESTMENT
                        IN IMPROVED SERVICES. STARTING WITH THE WATER INDUSTRY,
                        WE WILL ENCOURAGE UTILITIES TO INVOLVE THEIR CONSUMERS 
IN
                        OWNERSHIP AND CONTROL OF THEIR COMPANY, THROUGH MUTUAL
                        STRUCTURES.
                      * REINFORCE CONSUMER AND INVESTOR PROTECTION. WE WILL
                        INTRODUCE INDEPENDENT REGULATION OF FINANCIAL SERVICES
                        AND IMPROVE PROCESSES FOR REDRESS (E.G. FOR MIS-
SELLING).
                        WE WILL PROTECT PENSION AND LIFE ASSURANCE SAVINGS FROM
                        FRAUD. WE WILL WORK TO MAINTAIN THE CITY OF LONDON'S
                        PRE-EMINENCE AS A FINANCIAL CENTRE AND PROMOTE EFFECTIVE
                        INTERNATIONAL BANKING STANDARDS.

                    NATURAL RESOURCES.

                    
                   OUR PRIORITIES ARE TO:

                      * CUT TAXES ON THINGS WE WANT TO ENCOURAGE, LIKE JOBS, BY
                        TAXING POLLUTION INSTEAD. THIS WILL NOT MEAN MORE TAX, 
IT
                        WILL MEAN TAXING DIFFERENTLY.
                      * BUILD ENVIRONMENTAL OBJECTIVES INTO EVERY GOVERNMENT
                        POLICY.
                      * SET TOUGH TARGETS TO CUT ENERGY WASTE, REDUCE TRAFFIC
                        CONGESTION AND CONTROL POLLUTION.

                   A GREENER ECONOMY
                   ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION MUST BE BUILT INTO EVERY ECONOMIC
                   DECISION AND EVERY AREA OF GOVERNMENT POLICY.

                   WE WILL:

                      * SET TOUGH NEW TARGETS FOR THE REDUCTION OF TRAFFIC
                        POLLUTION AND WASTE. THIS WILL HELP REDUCE GLOBAL
                        WARMING, CUT AIR POLLUTION AND PREVENT WASTE. OUR 
TARGETS
                        INCLUDE CUTTING CARBON DIOXIDE EMISSIONS (THE MAIN CAUSE
                        OF CLIMATE CHANGE) BY 30 PER CENT FROM THE 1990 LEVEL
                        OVER THE NEXT 15 YEARS.
                      * CUT VAT AND TAXES ON JOBS, AND MAKE UP THE DIFFERENCE BY
                        TAXING POLLUTION INSTEAD. THIS WILL HELP CREATE MORE 
JOBS
                        AND A BETTER STANDARD OF LIVING.
                      * ADOPT A GREEN ACTION PROGRAMME. WE WILL SET TARGETS FOR
                        SUSTAINABILITY AND BIODIVERSITY, TO BE MET BY CENTRAL 
AND
                        LOCAL GOVERNMENT. WE WILL MEASURE THESE BY USING NEW
                        INDICATORS OF QUALITY OF LIFE, PROGRESS AND WEALTH. THE
                        PRIME MINISTER WILL REPORT TO PARLIAMENT EACH YEAR ON 
THE
                        COUNTRY'S SUCCESS IN MEETING THESE ENVIRONMENTAL 
TARGETS.
                      * PROTECT THE LOCAL ENVIRONMENT. WE WILL PASS STRONGER 
LAWS
                        TO CONSERVE THE COUNTRYSIDE. WE WILL CUT ROAD CONGESTION
                        AND HELP LOCAL COUNCILS MAKE BRITAIN'S TOWNS AND CITIES
                        HEALTHIER AND CLEANER PLACES TO LIVE.
                      * IMPROVE THE WAY ENVIRONMENT POLICY IS MADE. ENVIRONMENT
                        POLICY IS CURRENTLY BURIED, WITH HOUSING AND LOCAL
                        GOVERNMENT, IN A HUGE SINGLE GOVERNMENT DEPARTMENT. WE
                        WILL PUT ENVIRONMENT AND ENERGY POLICY WITHIN A 
SEPARATE,
                        NEW DEPARTMENT AND ENSURE THAT ALL GOVERNMENT 
DEPARTMENTS
                        AND AGENCIES PURSUE ENVIRONMENTALLY-FRIENDLY POLICIES. 
WE
                        WILL GIVE THE ENVIRONMENT AGENCY STRONGER POWERS TO
                        ENFORCE COMPLIANCE WITH ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS.

                   TRANSPORTING PEOPLE, TACKLING POLLUTION
                   TRAVEL DELAYS AND ROAD CONGESTION COST BILLIONS OF POUNDS, 
AND
                   POLLUTION DAMAGES THE HEALTH OF MILLIONS OF PEOPLE.

                   WE WILL:

                      * INVEST IN PUBLIC TRANSPORT BY BUILDING NEW PARTNERSHIPS
                        WITH THE PRIVATE SECTOR. WE WILL ENABLE COUNCILS TO
                        INTRODUCE ROAD PRICING IN THE MOST CONGESTED URBAN AREAS
                        AND USE THE MONEY TO SUPPORT CLEAN AND RAPID PUBLIC
                        TRANSPORT, AND TO IMPROVE CYCLE AND PEDESTRIAN ACCESS. 
WE
                        WILL RETAIN LONDON UNDERGROUND IN PUBLIC OWNERSHIP AND
                        GIVE IT THE RIGHT TO SEEK PRIVATE FINANCE FOR NEW
                        INVESTMENT WITHOUT AN ASSURED GOVERNMENT GUARANTEE.
                      * TREBLE THE FREIGHT AND DOUBLE THE NUMBER OF PASSENGERS
                        CARRIED ON BRITAIN'S RAILWAYS BY THE YEAR 2010. WE WILL
                        STRENGTHEN THE POWERS OF THE RAIL REGULATORS. WE WILL
                        REQUIRE RAILTRACK TO MEET TARGETS FOR GREATER INVESTMENT
                        AND INCREASED PASSENGER AND FREIGHT TRAFFIC. WE WILL
                        WITHHOLD PUBLIC SUBSIDIES FROM RAILTRACK IF THE TARGETS
                        ARE NOT MET AND, IN THE CASE OF PERSISTENT FAILURE, USE
                        THE FUNDS TO REACQUIRE A CONTROLLING INTEREST IN
                        RAILTRACK. WE WILL PROVIDE FOR LEGISLATION ENABLING 
THIS.
                      * ENCOURAGE PEOPLE TO DRIVE MORE FUEL-EFFICIENT CARS BY
                        CUTTING THE ANNUAL CAR TAX, FROM £145 TO £10 FOR CARS UP
                        TO 1600CC, OVER THE PERIOD OF THE NEXT PARLIAMENT, 
FUNDED
                        BY GRADUALLY RAISING THE DUTY ON FUEL BY APPROXIMATELY 4
                        PENCE PER LITRE. UNDER OUR PROPOSALS, A PERSON WITH A
                        TYPICAL FAMILY CAR COULD DRIVE UP TO 23,000 MILES PER
                        YEAR AND STILL BE BETTER OFF - EVEN IN RURAL AREAS, 
WHERE
                        THE AVERAGE MOTORIST ONLY DRIVES 11,700 MILES A YEAR. WE
                        WILL REFORM TAX RELIEF ON COMPANY CARS TO ENCOURAGE
                        SMALLER CARS AND GIVE PEOPLE NEW INCENTIVES TO USE 
PUBLIC
                        TRANSPORT FOR GETTING TO WORK.
                      * REDUCE THE NEED TO TRAVEL. WE WILL REFORM THE PLANNING
                        SYSTEM SO THAT PEOPLE HAVE EASIER ACCESS TO SHOPS,
                        OFFICES AND FACILITIES, AND PROMOTE THE USE OF
                        INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY TO DECENTRALISE WORK.

                   WARMER HOMES, SAVING ENERGY
                   OFFICIAL GOVERNMENT FIGURES SHOW THAT HALF THE ENERGY USED IN
                   BRITAIN IS WASTED. THIS PUSHES UP FUEL BILLS, WORSENS
                   POLLUTION AND SPEEDS UP GLOBAL WARMING.

                   WE WILL:

                      * CUT FUEL BILLS AND MAKE HOMES WARMER. WE WILL LAUNCH A
                        NATIONAL HOMES INSULATION PROGRAMME TO END FUEL POVERTY
                        STARTING WITH THE 2 MILLION LOWEST INCOME HOUSEHOLDS. 
OUR
                        PROPOSALS WILL BE FUNDED BY THE ENERGY SAVING TRUST AND
                        THE ENERGY SUPPLY COMPANIES. THIS WILL SAVE THESE
                        HOUSEHOLDS AN AVERAGE £85 PER YEAR AND REDUCE GLOBAL
                        WARMING EMISSIONS. BY CONTRAST, CUTTING VAT ON FUEL 
BILLS
                        TO 5 PER CENT WOULD SAVE THE AVERAGE HOUSEHOLD ONLY £19
                        PER YEAR.
                      * CUT TAXES ON PEOPLE BY TAXING POLLUTION INSTEAD. TO
                        ENCOURAGE ENERGY SAVING, WE WILL GRADUALLY INTRODUCE A
                        'CARBON TAX' ON FOSSIL FUELS, USING THE FUNDS RAISED TO
                        CUT VAT AND EMPLOYERS' NATIONAL INSURANCE CONTRIBUTIONS
                        (THE TAX ON JOBS). THIS IS A TAX SWITCH, NOT A TAX RISE,
                        AND WILL BE PHASED IN GRADUALLY.
                      * IMPROVE ENERGY EFFICIENCY. WE WILL BRING IN NEW MINIMUM
                        STANDARDS FOR THE ENERGY EFFICIENCY OF PRODUCTS,
                        BUILDINGS AND VEHICLES. WE WILL CUT VAT ON ENERGY
                        CONSERVATION MATERIALS TO 8 PER CENT - THE SAME AS FOR
                        ENERGY SUPPLIES.
                      * PROMOTE RENEWABLE SOURCES OF ENERGY AND COMBINED HEAT 
AND
                        POWER SCHEMES. WE WILL SHIFT FUNDS FROM NUCLEAR RESEARCH
                        INTO DECOMMISSIONING AND NUCLEAR WASTE MANAGEMENT, AND
                        SUPPORT RESEARCH FOR RENEWABLE ENERGY SOURCES. WE WILL
                        NOT PROVIDE ANY GOVERNMENT SUBSIDIES FOR NUCLEAR
                        GENERATION. WE SUPPORT ON-SITE DRY STORAGE OF NUCLEAR
                        WASTE, PENDING THE LONG-TERM DEVELOPMENT OF SAFE
                        ALTERNATIVES. NUCLEAR STATIONS WILL NOT BE REPLACED AT
                        THE END OF THEIR DESIGN LIFE.

                   PROTECTING BRITAIN'S HERITAGE
                   BRITAIN'S NATURAL ENVIRONMENT AND HERITAGE ARE BEING 
GRADUALLY
                   DESTROYED.

                   WE WILL:

                      * CLEAN UP BRITAIN'S RIVERS AND BEACHES AND ENSURE THAT 
THE
                        COSTS OF INVESTMENT ARE SPREAD FAIRLY. WE WILL REQUIRE
                        WATER COMPANIES TO CONTRIBUTE TO THE COST OF NATIONAL
                        ENVIRONMENTAL PROJECTS. WE WILL REDUCE THE NEED FOR NEW
                        WATER DEVELOPMENTS BY SETTING TARGETS TO REDUCE LEAKAGE
                        AND BY PROMOTING EFFICIENCY IN WATER USE. WE WILL
                        INTRODUCE A FAIRER SYSTEM OF CHARGING FOR WATER AND
                        REQUIRE WATER COMPANIES TO SHARE EXCESS PROFITS WITH
                        THEIR CUSTOMERS THROUGH REBATES OR INVESTMENTS IN
                        ENVIRONMENTAL IMPROVEMENTS. WE WILL END, WITHIN 10 
YEARS,
                        DISCHARGES THAT CAUSE UNNECESSARY WATER POLLUTION.
                      * TACKLE MARINE OIL POLLUTION. WE WILL IMPLEMENT TOUGHER
                        RULES ON SHIPPING SAFETY AND BRING FORWARD THE
                        DESIGNATION OF MARINE HIGH RISK AREAS.
                      * REFORM LAND USE PLANNING. WE WILL MAKE PROTECTION OF THE
                        NATURAL ENVIRONMENT A MAJOR FEATURE OF THE PLANNING
                        SYSTEM THROUGH A NEW WILDLIFE ACT. THIS WILL IMPROVE
                        PROTECTION OF NATIONAL PARKS, HERITAGE COASTS, SITES OF
                        SPECIAL SCIENTIFIC INTEREST AND AREAS OF OUTSTANDING
                        NATURAL BEAUTY.
                      * GREEN THE COUNTRYSIDE. OUR PROPOSED NEW COUNTRYSIDE
                        MANAGEMENT CONTRACTS WILL HELP FARMERS TO PROTECT VITAL
                        HABITATS AND CONVERT TO MORE ENVIRONMENTALLY-FRIENDLY
                        FARMING METHODS. WE WILL USE TAX AND PLANNING REFORMS TO
                        PROTECT RURAL AREAS, ENCOURAGING DEVELOPMENT ON DERELICT
                        LAND SITES RATHER THAN GREEN FIELDS.

                   THINKING GLOBALLY, ACTING LOCALLY
                   MOST PEOPLE UNDERSTAND THE IMPORTANCE OF THINKING GLOBALLY 
AND
                   ACTING LOCALLY. THEY WANT TO PLAY THEIR PART IN PROTECTING 
THE
                   ENVIRONMENT. GOVERNMENT SHOULD HELP THEM DO SO.

                   WE WILL:

                      * ENCOURAGE THE MANUFACTURE OF PRODUCTS THAT ARE EASIER TO
                        REPAIR, REUSE OR RECYCLE. WE WILL INTRODUCE DEPOSIT
                        REFUND SCHEMES AND BACK EU-WIDE STANDARDS FOR PRODUCT
                        DESIGN, ENERGY EFFICIENCY AND REUSE.
                      * HELP PEOPLE TO CHOOSE ENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY PRODUCTS.
                        WE WILL PRESS FOR COMPREHENSIVE AND UNDERSTANDABLE
                        EU-WIDE ECOLOGICALLY FRIENDLY AND ENERGY EFFICIENT
                        LABELLING SCHEMES.

                   PROMOTING ANIMAL WELFARE
                   THE WAY A SOCIETY TREATS ANIMALS IS A MEASURE OF ITS
                   CIVILISATION.

                   WE WILL:

                      * PROMOTE ANIMAL WELFARE. WE WILL SET UP A COMPULSORY
                        NATIONAL DOG REGISTRATION SCHEME. WE WILL HALT THE TRADE
                        IN ENDANGERED SPECIES AS PETS. WE WILL PROMOTE AND 
EXTEND
                        TRAINING AND QUALIFICATION FOR THOSE WHO WORK WITH
                        LIVESTOCK. WE WILL INSIST ON THE ENFORCEMENT OF MAXIMUM
                        TIME LIMITS AND FOR TRANSPORTING LIVE ANIMALS IN THE EU,
                        A STRICTER TIMETABLE FOR BANNING VEAL CRATES AND 
IMPROVED
                        REARING CONDITIONS FOR PIGS AND CHICKENS ACROSS THE EU.
                        WE WILL CREATE AN ANIMAL PROTECTION COMMISSION TO 
ENFORCE
                        ANIMAL WELFARE LAWS AND IMPROVE ANIMAL WELFARE 
STANDARDS.
                        WE WILL BAN ANIMAL TESTING FOR COSMETICS, WEAPONS AND
                        TOBACCO PRODUCTS. WE WILL REVIEW THE LAW IN ORDER TO
                        REDUCE THE USE OF ANIMALS IN SCIENTIFIC EXPERIMENTS AND
                        SEEK THE DEVELOPMENT OF ALTERNATIVES.
                      * PROTECT WILD ANIMALS. WE BELIEVE THAT THE ISSUES OF
                        HUNTING WITH HOUNDS AND COURSING SHOULD BE DECIDED BY
                        FREE VOTES IN THE HOUSE OF COMMONS. WE WILL BAN SNARES
                        AND LEG HOLD TRAPS. WE WILL PRESS FOR STRONGER
                        INTERNATIONAL LAWS TO PROTECT ENDANGERED SPECIES. WE 
WILL
                        BAN THE IMPORTATION OF PRODUCTS DERIVED FROM THREATENED
                        WILD ANIMALS.

OUR AIM:TO GIVE EVERY PERSON IN BRITAIN THE SECURITY OF A
                    DECENT HOME IN A SAFE, STRONG COMMUNITY.

                    THE PROBLEM: CRIME, HOMELESSNESS AND INSECURITY NOW
                    THREATEN THE VERY FABRIC OF BRITISH SOCIETY. MANY PEOPLE
                    FEEL TOO FRIGHTENED TO LEAVE THEIR HOMES. MANY DO NOT HAVE
                    A DECENT HOME. OUR COUNTRY IS BECOMING MORE AND MORE
                    DIVIDED, OUR SENSE OF COMMUNITY IS BEING LOST AND OUR
                    SHARED VALUES ARE BEING UNDERMINED.

                    OUR COMMITMENT: LIBERAL DEMOCRATS WILL PURSUE PRACTICAL
                    MEASURES TO REBUILD BRITAIN'S COMMUNITIES, TACKLE THE
                    CAUSES OF CRIME, REDUCE HOMELESSNESS AND MAKE PEOPLE SAFER
                    IN THEIR HOMES AND ON THE STREETS.

                    
                   OUR PRIORITIES ARE TO:

                      * PUT 3,000 MORE POLICE OFFICERS ON THE BEAT.
                      * BUILD MORE AFFORDABLE AND SECURE HOUSING.
                      * END, BY THE YEAR 2000, THE SCANDAL OF PEOPLE BEING 
FORCED
                        TO SLEEP ROUGH ON THE STREETS.
                      * REVIVE BRITAIN'S SENSE OF COMMUNITY.

                   HOUSING
                   BOOM AND BUST HOUSE PRICES, A SHORTAGE OF DECENT HOMES AND
                   POOR HOUSING HAVE WRECKED THE LIVES OF MILLIONS AND DAMAGED
                   BRITAIN'S ECONOMY.

                   WE WILL:

                      * BUILD MORE HOUSES. WE WILL ENCOURAGE PARTNERSHIPS 
BETWEEN
                        THE PUBLIC SECTOR, THE PRIVATE SECTOR AND HOUSING
                        ASSOCIATIONS TO BUILD HIGH QUALITY HOMES TO RENT AND 
BUY.
                        WE WILL, WITHIN STRICT BORROWING CONTROLS, GIVE LOCAL
                        AUTHORITIES MORE POWERS TO GO DIRECTLY TO THE MARKET TO
                        RAISE FINANCE FOR BUILDING NEW HOMES. WE WILL BEGIN THE
                        PHASED RELEASE OF CAPITAL RECEIPTS FROM PAST SALES OF
                        COUNCIL HOUSES AND ALLOW THE MONEY TO BE USED TO BUILD
                        NEW HOMES.
                      * GIVE FINANCIAL SECURITY TO ALL, WHETHER THEY RENT OR OWN
                        THEIR HOMES. WE WILL INTRODUCE A NEW MORTGAGE BENEFIT 
FOR
                        FIRST TIME BUYERS. THEY WILL RECEIVE THIS INSTEAD OF
                        MORTGAGE INTEREST TAX RELIEF. THOSE HOLDING CURRENT
                        MORTGAGES WILL RETAIN MORTGAGE INTEREST TAX RELIEF. OUR
                        AIM IS, OVER TIME, TO MERGE THE NEW MORTGAGE BENEFIT AND
                        THE CURRENT HOUSING BENEFIT INTO ONE SYSTEM OF HOUSING
                        COST RELIEF, AVAILABLE TO THOSE WHO BUY OR RENT AND
                        FOCUSED ON THOSE MOST IN NEED.
                      * END THE SCANDAL OF PEOPLE BEING FORCED TO SLEEP ROUGH ON
                        THE STREETS. WE WILL ENSURE THAT BY THE YEAR 2000 NO ONE
                        IS FORCED TO SLEEP ON THE STREETS. WE WILL REQUIRE EVERY
                        COUNCIL TO SET UP SELF-FUNDING RENT DEPOSIT SCHEMES TO
                        HELP HOMELESS PEOPLE TAKE UP PRIVATE TENANCIES. WE WILL
                        FUND MORE SHORT-STAY HOSTEL PLACES AS THE FIRST RUNG ON
                        THE LADDER TO PERMANENT ACCOMMODATION.
                      * TAKE ACTION TO TACKLE HOMELESSNESS AND RAISE HOUSING
                        STANDARDS. WE WILL GIVE COUNCILS GREATER POWER TO ACT ON
                        UNFIT PRIVATE HOUSING, WHERE THE LANDLORD HAS FAILED TO
                        DO SO. WE WILL STRENGTHEN TENANTS' RIGHTS TO REPAIR AND,
                        IN THE PUBLIC SECTOR, GIVE THEM RIGHTS TO TAKE PART IN
                        THE MANAGEMENT AND DEVELOPMENT OF THEIR HOMES AND
                        ESTATES. OUR EMPTY HOMES STRATEGY WILL ENABLE LOCAL
                        AUTHORITIES TO WORK WITH, AND AS A LAST RESORT REQUIRE,
                        LANDLORDS TO BRING EMPTY PROPERTIES BACK INTO USE. WE
                        WILL END DISCRIMINATION AGAINST THOSE UNDER 25 BY
                        SCRAPPING THE 'SHARED RESIDENCY RULE' WHEN ASSESSING
                        HOUSING BENEFIT.
                      * BRING CONFIDENCE BACK TO THE HOUSING MARKET BY TARGETING
                        LOW INFLATION AND LOW INTEREST RATES.

                   CRIME AND POLICING
                   CRIME AND THE FEAR OF CRIME AFFECT ALMOST EVERY PERSON AND
                   EVERY COMMUNITY IN THE COUNTRY.

                   WE WILL:

                      * PUT 3,000 MORE POLICE OFFICERS ON THE BEAT. WITHIN ONE
                        YEAR, WE WILL GIVE POLICE AUTHORITIES THE RESOURCES TO
                        PUT AN EXTRA 3,000 POLICE OFFICERS ON THE BEAT. WE WILL
                        INCREASE THE TIME THE POLICE SPEND ON PREVENTING AND
                        DETECTING CRIME BY REDUCING UNNECESSARY PAPERWORK AND
                        MAKING GREATER USE OF NEW TECHNOLOGIES.
                      * TACKLE YOUTH CRIME. WE WILL WIDEN THE USE OF SCHEMES 
THAT
                        REQUIRE OFFENDERS TO REPAY THEIR DEBT TO SOCIETY AND TO
                        CONFRONT THE CONSEQUENCES OF THEIR ACTIONS. WE WILL,
                        WHERE APPROPRIATE, REQUIRE PARENTS TO PARTICIPATE IN
                        SUPPORT PROJECTS WHERE THEIR CHILDREN HAVE BEEN INVOLVED
                        IN JUVENILE CRIME. WE WILL DEVELOP SCHEMES THAT TARGET
                        DISRUPTIVE CHILDREN FROM AN EARLY AGE. WE WILL RESERVE
                        CUSTODIAL SENTENCES FOR MORE SERIOUS AND PERSISTENT
                        OFFENDERS. OUR VOLUNTARY CITIZENS SERVICE WILL ENABLE
                        YOUNG PEOPLE TO GET DIRECTLY INVOLVED IN CRIME 
PREVENTION
                        SCHEMES.
                      * STRENGTHEN THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM. WE WILL MAKE THE
                        JUSTICE SYSTEM WORK MORE QUICKLY AND EFFECTIVELY AND
                        REVIEW SENTENCING POLICY. WE WILL OVERHAUL THE CROWN
                        PROSECUTION SERVICE. WE WILL ENCOURAGE THE USE OF
                        COMMUNITY SENTENCES, AS AN ALTERNATIVE TO PRISON, WHERE
                        THE RESULT IS LIKELY TO BE LESS REOFFENDING, AND USE
                        PRISON SENTENCES WHERE THEY ARE ESSENTIAL TO PUBLIC
                        PROTECTION OR TO MAKE PUNISHMENT EFFECTIVE. WE WILL
                        CONCENTRATE RESOURCES ON CRIME PREVENTION AND ON
                        INCREASING CONVICTION RATES, RATHER THAN SPENDING
                        BILLIONS ON BUILDING PRISONS.
                      * FOCUS ON CRIME PREVENTION. WE WILL REQUIRE COUNCILS TO
                        TAKE THE LEAD IN ESTABLISHING CROSS-COMMUNITY
                        PARTNERSHIPS AGAINST CRIME, SETTING SPECIFIC TARGETS FOR
                        CRIME PREVENTION. WE WILL GIVE COUNCILS POWERS AND
                        RESOURCES TO SUPPORT HIGH-QUALITY, TARGETED CRIME
                        PREVENTION INITIATIVES.
                      * WAGE WAR ON DRUG ABUSE. WE WILL GIVE THE POLICE AND
                        CUSTOMS AND EXCISE THE SUPPORT THEY NEED TO STOP DRUGS
                        COMING INTO BRITAIN. WE WILL SET UP A ROYAL COMMISSION
                        CHARGED WITH DEVELOPING POLICIES TO TACKLE THE DRUGS
                        PROBLEM AT ITS ROOTS.
                      * GIVE VICTIMS A NEW DEAL. WE WILL PROMOTE RESTORATIVE
                        JUSTICE, UNDER WHICH OFFENDERS CAN BE REQUIRED TO
                        COMPENSATE VICTIMS FOR THE DAMAGE THEY HAVE CAUSED. WE
                        WILL ENSURE THAT THE VICTIM SUPPORT MOVEMENT AND THE
                        WITNESS SUPPORT SCHEMES PLAY A FULL ROLE IN THE CRIMINAL
                        JUSTICE SYSTEM. WE WILL PROVIDE VICTIMS WITH THE
                        PRACTICAL SUPPORT THEY NEED TO PREVENT REPEAT ATTACKS.
                      * STRENGTHEN PUBLIC CONFIDENCE IN THE POLICE. WE WILL MAKE
                        POLICE AUTHORITIES MORE RESPONSIVE TO LOCAL COMMUNITIES
                        BY INCREASING THEIR ELECTED MEMBERSHIP AND CREATING AN
                        ACCOUNTABLE POLICE AUTHORITY FOR LONDON. WE WILL IMPROVE
                        CO-OPERATION BETWEEN POLICE FORCES AND WORK MORE CLOSELY
                        WITH BRITAIN'S EUROPEAN PARTNERS TO COMBAT INTERNATIONAL
                        CRIME, TERRORISM, DRUG TRAFFICKING AND FRAUD. WE WILL
                        ENSURE THAT THE POLICE TAKE FURTHER STEPS TO REDUCE THE
                        LEVEL OF RACIAL AND HOMOPHOBIC VIOLENCE.

                   RURAL COMMUNITIES
                   BRITAIN'S RURAL ECONOMY AND COMMUNITIES HAVE BEEN TRANSFORMED
                   OVER THE LAST FIFTY YEARS. THE CHALLENGE FOR THE NEXT FIFTY
                   YEARS IS TO PROTECT AND ENHANCE THE RICHNESS OF RURAL LIFE,
                   WHILE DEVELOPING A THRIVING RURAL ECONOMY.

                   WE WILL:

                      * SEEK FURTHER REFORM OF THE COMMON AGRICULTURAL POLICY
                        (CAP). WE WILL WORK TO REPLACE THECAP, WHICH CURRENTLY
                        SUBSIDISES PRODUCTION, WITH COUNTRYSIDE MANAGEMENT
                        CONTRACTS - A TARGETED SYSTEM OF DIRECT PAYMENTS TO
                        SUPPORT ECONOMIC, SOCIAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL GOALS IN 
RURAL
                        COMMUNITIES. COUNTRYSIDE MANAGEMENT CONTRACTS WILL 
ENABLE
                        FARMERS AND LANDOWNERS TO CHOOSE FROM A WIDE RANGE OF
                        OPTIONS, FOR EXAMPLE, TO IMPROVE THE RURAL ENVIRONMENT,
                        MAXIMISE FOOD QUALITY, PROTECT NATURAL HABITATS OR MOVE
                        TO LESS INTENSIVE OR ORGANIC FARMING METHODS.
                      * HELP RURAL ECONOMIES THROUGH A PERIOD OF CHANGE. WE 
WILL,
                        IN PARTNERSHIP WITH THE AGRICULTURE INDUSTRY, DRAW UP A
                        NATIONAL STRATEGY FOR FARMING IN ORDER TO PROVIDE A
                        FRAMEWORK FOR PUBLIC POLICY AND PRIVATE DECISION-MAKING
                        OVER THE NEXT 10 YEARS. WE WILL PROMOTE AGRICULTURAL
                        RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT, AND ASSIST FARMERS WISHING TO
                        DIVERSIFY. WE WILL PROMOTE LOCAL PROCESSING OF
                        AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTS AND EXPAND SUPPORT FOR SMALL AND
                        MEDIUM-SIZED ENTERPRISES IN RURAL AREAS.
                      * TACKLE RURAL CRIME. WE WILL PUT MORE POLICE INTO RURAL
                        AREAS, SUPPORT FARM AND NEIGHBOURHOOD WATCH SCHEMES AND
                        GIVE COUNCILS THE DUTY TO SET UP CRIME PREVENTION 
SCHEMES
                        WITH THE LOCAL POLICE. WE WILL ENABLE RURAL POLICE
                        AUTHORITIES TO INTRODUCE MORTGAGE INCENTIVE SCHEMES TO
                        ENCOURAGE RURAL BEAT OFFICERS TO LIVE IN THE AREAS THEY
                        SERVE.
                      * ENHANCE RURAL SERVICES. WE WILL SUPPORT SMALLER VILLAGE
                        SCHOOLS THROUGH GREATER USE OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY 
AND
                        SPECIALIST TEACHING TEAMS. WE WILL ENCOURAGE SCHEMES 
THAT
                        ENABLE LOCAL COMMUNITIES TO MAKE USE OF SCHOOL BUILDINGS
                        AND EQUIPMENT. WE WILL PROMOTE COMMUNITY HOSPITALS AND
                        USE THEM FOR MORE OUT-PATIENT CONSULTATIONS.
                      * PROVIDE MORE AFFORDABLE RURAL HOUSING. WE WILL ENCOURAGE
                        HOUSING AUTHORITIES, PARISH COUNCILS AND HOUSING

                        PRIVATE SECTOR IN ORDER TO BUILD LOW-COST HOMES FOR
                        FIRST-TIME HOME BUYERS AND SOCIAL NEEDS.
                      * IMPROVE RURAL TRANSPORT. WE WILL GIVE LOCAL AUTHORITIES
                        THE POWER TO IMPROVE THE CO-ORDINATION OF LOCAL BUS
                        SERVICES AND TO REOPEN CLOSED RAILWAY STATIONS, IN
                        CO-OPERATION WITH RAILTRACK.
                      * STRENGTHEN THE NETWORK OF RURAL SUB-POST OFFICES AND
                        VILLAGE SHOPS. WE WILL ENCOURAGE THE POST OFFICE TO
                        INVEST IN NEW POINT OF SALE TECHNOLOGIES, IN ORDER TO
                        PROVIDE ACCESS, THROUGH SUB-POST OFFICES, TO A WIDE 
RANGE
                        OF CUSTOMER SERVICES. WHERE POST OFFICES AND VILLAGE
                        SHOPS WHICH ARE VITAL TO THEIR LOCAL COMMUNITY ARE
                        THREATENED, WE WILL ENABLE LOCAL COUNCILS TO SUPPORT 
THEM
                        WITH UP TO 100 PER CENT RATE RELIEF.
                      * PROTECT THE COUNTRYSIDE. WE WILL HELP LANDOWNERS MEET 
THE
                        ENVIRONMENTAL COSTS OF INCREASED ACCESS TO THE
                        COUNTRYSIDE. WE WILL TAKE ACTION TO REDUCE THE USE OF
                        CHEMICALS IN FARMING.
                      * PROTECT RURAL AREAS FROM URBANISATION. WE WILL PENALISE
                        THE USE OF GREENFIELD SITES, SET AND ENFORCE TARGETS FOR
                        GREATER USE OF BROWNLAND SITES AND ENCOURAGE
                        OVER-THE-SHOP ACCOMMODATION IN MARKET TOWN CENTRES. WE
                        WILL REVIEW THE EXCESSIVE HOUSING TOTALS IN THE CURRENT
                        STRUCTURE PLANS AND SCRAP THE 'PREDICT AND PROVIDE'
                        APPROACH TO HOUSING DEVELOPMENT.
                      * WORK TO PRESERVE FISH STOCKS AND PROTECT THE LIVELIHOODS
                        OF LOCAL FISHING COMMUNITIES. OUR AIM IS TO SCRAP THE
                        COMMON FISHERIES POLICY AND REPLACE IT WITH A NEW
                        EUROPE-WIDE FISHERIES POLICY BASED ON THE REGIONAL
                        MANAGEMENT OF FISH STOCKS. WE WILL TAKE FIRM ACTION TO
                        END QUOTA-HOPPING, BEGIN THE PHASED ABOLITION OF
                        INDUSTRIAL FISHING AND STRENGTHEN DECOMMISSIONING
                        INCENTIVES.
                      * PROMOTE SAFE FOOD. WE WILL SET UP A FOOD COMMISSION,
                        INDEPENDENT FROM MAFF AND ACCOUNTABLE TO PARLIAMENT,

AND
                        PRESS FOR HIGHER COMMON FOOD STANDARDS ACROSS THE
                        EUROPEAN UNION.

                   URBAN COMMUNITIES
                   BRITAIN'S TOWNS AND CITIES OFFER CIVIC PRIDE, ACCESSIBLE
                   FACILITIES AND, POTENTIALLY, A HIGH QUALITY OF LIFE. HOWEVER,
                   MANY SUFFER FROM ALIENATION, JOBLESSNESS, HIGH CRIME RATES, A
                   RUN-DOWN ENVIRONMENT AND LOSS OF POPULATION. URBAN AREAS
                   SHOULD OFFER EXCITEMENT, SECURITY AND A STRONG SENSE OF
                   COMMUNITY.

                   WE WILL:

                      * BOOST LOCAL ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AND JOB OPPORTUNITIES.
                        WE WILL SUPPORT LOCAL DEVELOPMENT CORPORATIONS. WE WILL
                        BUILD NEW PARTNERSHIPS BETWEEN LOCAL GOVERNMENT AND THE
                        PRIVATE AND VOLUNTARY SECTORS, TO REGENERATE LOCAL
                        ECONOMIES AND PROMOTE COMMUNITY ENTERPRISE. WE WILL LINK
                        LOCAL TRAINING TO LOCAL JOBS. WE WILL ENCOURAGE THE
                        ESTABLISHMENT OF COMMUNITY BANKS AND CREDIT UNIONS.
                      * TACKLE URBAN CRIME. WE WILL EXPAND COMMUNITY POLICING,
                        ENSURE THAT ALL NEW PLANNING TAKES ACCOUNT OF THE NEED 
TO
                        DETER CRIME AND FOCUS ON CRIME PREVENTION.
                      * ENCOURAGE PUBLIC TRANSPORT. WE WILL ENABLE COUNCILS TO
                        CO-ORDINATE BUS AND TRAIN SERVICES AND GIVE THEM POWERS
                        TO INTRODUCE URBAN ROAD PRICING SCHEMES, USING THE
                        REVENUE RAISED TO INVEST IN BETTER PUBLIC TRANSPORT.
                      * REFORM AND STRENGTHEN ELECTED LOCAL GOVERNMENT. WE WILL
                        GIVE LOCAL COUNCILS GREATER CONTROL OVER THEIR OWN
                        AFFAIRS. WE WILL CREATE A STRATEGIC AUTHORITY FOR 
LONDON.
                        WE WILL ENCOURAGE THE USE OF 'PLANNING FOR REAL'
                        STRATEGIES, IN WHICH LOCAL PEOPLE CAN MAKE A DIRECT 
INPUT
                        INTO MAJOR PLANNING PROJECTS IN THEIR COMMUNITY.

                   ARTS AND MEDIA
                   FLOURISHING ARTS AND A DIVERSE CULTURE ARE ESSENTIAL FOR A
                   LIVELY AND OPEN SOCIETY. THEY CAN BE ENGINES OF INNOVATION
                   THAT BRING LIFE TO THE ECONOMY. AT THE SAME TIME, THE WORLD 
IS
                   EXPERIENCING AN INFORMATION REVOLUTION AS IMPORTANT AND
                   FAR-REACHING AS THE INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION. BRITAIN MUST
                   MAINTAIN A FREE AND EFFECTIVE MEDIA CAPABLE OF BEING A CHECK
                   ON THE ABUSE OF POWER, AND OF GIVING PEOPLE THE INFORMATION
                   THEY NEED TO MAKE INFORMED DECISIONS.

                   WE WILL:

                      * TACKLE THE CONCENTRATION OF MEDIA POWER. WE WILL ACT TO
                        PREVENT MEDIA MERGERS OR TAKE-OVERS, EXCEPT WHERE THESE
                        CAN BE SHOWN TO ADVANCE QUALITY, DIVERSITY AND ACCESS. 
WE
                        WILL REQUIRE THE INDEPENDENT TELEVISION COMMISSION TO
                        PROTECT THE POSITION OF SMALLER REGIONAL ITV COMPANIES,
                        WITHIN THE NETWORK SUPPLY AGREEMENT.
                      * MAINTAIN THE ROLE OF THE BBC AS THE BENCHMARK OF PUBLIC
                        SERVICE BROADCASTING, COMMITTED TO QUALITY, DIVERSITY 
AND
                        UNIVERSAL ACCESS. WE WILL PROTECT THE INDEPENDENCE AND
                        IMPARTIALITY OF THE BBC THROUGH ITS BOARD OF GOVERNORS
                        AND ITS LICENCE FEE.
                      * IMPROVE ACCESS TO INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY AND THE
                        INTERNET. WE WILL ENSURE THAT EVERYONE IN BRITAIN CAN
                        HAVE ACCESS, EITHER INDIVIDUALLY OR THROUGH A WIDE RANGE
                        OF PUBLIC ACCESS POINTS, TO A NATIONWIDE INTERACTIVE
                        COMMUNICATIONS NETWORK BY THE YEAR 2000.
                      * INCREASE ACCESS TO THE ARTS. WE WILL USE THE NATIONAL
                        LOTTERY TO ENDOW, HOUSE AND IMPROVE ACCESS TO THE ARTS.
                        WE AIM TO MOVE TOWARDS THE EUROPEAN AVERAGE FOR PUBLIC
                        FUNDING OF THE ARTS. WE AIM TO RESTORE THE PRINCIPLE OF
                        FREE ACCESS TO NATIONAL MUSEUM AND GALLERY COLLECTIONS,
                        STARTING WITH THE REMOVAL OF CHARGES FOR SCHOOL PARTIES.
                      * PROMOTE BRITAIN'S CULTURE. WE WILL PROMOTE FILM
                        PRODUCTION IN BRITAIN. WE WILL ACTIVELY SUPPORT THE
                        BRITISH COUNCIL AND REJOIN UNESCO. WE WILL ENHANCE THE
                        BBC WORLD SERVICE AS A NATIONAL ASSET.

OUR AIM: TO MAKE YEAR-ON-YEAR IMPROVEMENTS IN THE HEALTH OF
                    BRITAIN'S PEOPLE AND THE QUALITY OF THE NATIONAL HEALTH
                    SERVICE.

                    THE PROBLEM: THE NHS HAS BEEN SQUEEZED BETWEEN RISING
                    DEMAND AND GOVERNMENT UNDERFUNDING, AND DISRUPTED BY
                    REPEATED CHANGES IN GOVERNMENT POLICY. MORALE AMONGST NHS
                    PROFESSIONALS IS FALLING, AND BUREAUCRACY HAS GROWN AT THE
                    EXPENSE OF FRONT-LINE PATIENT CARE, WHILE NUMBERS OF NURSES
                    AND HOSPITAL BEDS HAVE FALLEN.

                    OUR COMMITMENT: LIBERAL DEMOCRATS WILL INCREASE FUNDING FOR
                    THE NHS AND SECURE FUNDING FOR THE FUTURE. WE WILL MAINTAIN
                    THE NHS AS A COMPREHENSIVE SERVICE, FREE AT THE POINT OF
                    NEED AND FUNDED PRIMARILY FROM GENERAL TAXATION. WE WILL
                    IMMEDIATELY TACKLE THE CRISIS IN THE HOSPITAL SECTOR, MAKE
                    THE NHS MORE ACCOUNTABLE AND BEGIN A LONG TERM SHIFT
                    TOWARDS PREVENTIVE MEDICINE.

                    
                   OUR PRIORITIES ARE TO:

                      * HALT ALL FINANCE DRIVEN CLOSURES FOR 6 MONTHS, PENDING 
AN
                        INDEPENDENT AUDIT OF NEEDS AND FACILITIES.
                      * INVEST £200 MILLION EACH YEAR TO RECRUIT MORE STAFF FOR
                        FRONT-LINE PATIENT CARE. THIS WOULD BE ENOUGH, FOR
                        EXAMPLE, FOR 10,000 EXTRA NURSES OR 5,000 EXTRA DOCTORS.
                      * CUT HOSPITAL WAITING LISTS TO A MAXIMUM OF 6 MONTHS OVER
                        3 YEARS.
                      * END THE TWO-TIER SYSTEM IN THE NHS.
                      * RESTORE FREE EYE AND DENTAL CHECKS.

                   RAISING STANDARDS IN THE NHS
                   WHILST MANY OF THE RECENT REFORMS TO THE NHS HAVE BEEN
                   BENEFICIAL, THEY HAVE RESULTED IN THE CREATION OF A TWO-TIER
                   HEALTH SERVICE. THE STANDARD OF HEALTH CARE A PERSON RECEIVES
                   IS INCREASINGLY BECOMING A LOTTERY. THE LENGTH OF TIME PEOPLE
                   HAVE TO WAIT, THE CHANCE OF TREATMENT BEING POSTPONED AND THE
                   QUALITY OF HEALTH CARE VARY ENORMOUSLY FROM ONE PART OF THE 
UK
                   TO ANOTHER.

                   WE WILL:
                   * MATCH NHS FACILITIES TO NEEDS. WE WILL PLACE AN IMMEDIATE
                   6-MONTH HALT ON THE FINANCE DRIVEN CLOSURE OF BEDS AND WARDS,
                   AND SET UP AN INDEPENDENT AUDIT OF NEEDS AND FACILITIES.
                   * END THE BUILT-IN TWO-TIER SERVICE IN THE NHS. WE WILL END
                   THE PRESENT SYSTEM WHERE TREATMENT DEPENDS ON THE TYPE OF GP
                   PEOPLE GO TO. WE WILL TREAT ALL GPS EQUALLY, WITH A COMMON
                   BASIS FOR FUNDING. WE WANT ALL GPS TO HAVE THE BENEFITS OF
                   FLEXIBILITY AND ACCESS TO SERVICES CURRENTLY ENJOYED BY
                   FUNDHOLDERS. THOSE WHO CHOOSE TO MANAGE THEIR OWN AFFAIRS 
WILL
                   BE ABLE TO DO SO ON THEIR OWN OR AS PART OF A CONSORTIUM.
                   THOSE WHO DO NOT WILL BE ABLE TO LEAVE MANAGEMENT TO THE 
LOCAL
                   HEALTH AUTHORITY.
                   * RAISE STANDARDS OF CARE IN ALL AREAS. WE WILL SET UP A
                   NATIONAL INSPECTORATE FOR HEALTH AND SOCIAL CARE TO IMPROVE
                   STANDARDS AND PROMOTE PATIENTS' INTERESTS. THIS BODY WILL 
WORK
                   WITH THE AUDIT COMMISSION TO ENSURE THAT ALL SPENDING IS
                   MONITORED AND RESULTS IN REAL IMPROVEMENTS IN PATIENT CARE.

                   FUNDING THE HEALTH SERVICE
                   THE NHS IS UNDERFUNDED. TOO MUCH GOES INTO BUREAUCRACY AND 
NOT
                   ENOUGH INTO PATIENT CARE. THERE IS A CRISIS IN THE NHS,
                   ESPECIALLY IN HOSPITALS. MORALE IS DROPPING, STANDARDS OF 
CARE
                   ARE AT RISK FROM UNDERFUNDING AND HIGHLY QUALIFIED DOCTORS 
AND
                   NURSES ARE LEAVING THE PROFESSION.

                   WE WILL:

                      * INVEST MORE IN THE NHS. WE WILL INVEST AT LEAST AN EXTRA
                        £540 MILLION EVERY YEAR IN THE NHS TO PAY FOR OUR POLICY
                        PRIORITIES. THIS WILL BE PAID FOR BY CLOSING THE 
LOOPHOLE
                        THAT ALLOWS EMPLOYERS TO AVOID PAYING NATIONAL INSURANCE
                        CONTRIBUTIONS ON CERTAIN BENEFITS IN KIND AND BY PUTTING
                        5P ON THE PRICE OF A PACKET OF 20 CIGARETTES. WE WILL 
USE
                        THESE EXTRA FUNDS TO TACKLE THE CRISIS IN STAFFING,
                        ESPECIALLY IN THE HOSPITAL SECTOR, AND BEGIN A SHIFT TO
                        PREVENTIVE CARE. WE WILL ENSURE THAT THE NHS BUDGET 
KEEPS
                        PACE WITH INCREASING COST PRESSURES.
                      * SHIFT MONEY FROM UNNECESSARY BUREAUCRACY INTO PATIENT
                        CARE. WE WILL MOVE FROM ANNUAL TO AT LEAST THREE YEARLY
                        CONTRACTS BETWEEN HEALTH AUTHORITIES AND TRUSTS, AND
                        SHIFT THE MONEY SAVED INTO FRONT-LINE PATIENT CARE. WE
                        WILL REPLACE TIME CONSUMING LOCAL PAY BARGAINING WITH A
                        NEW NATIONAL PAY STRUCTURE AND A SINGLE NHS-WIDE PAY
                        REVIEW BODY THAT COVERS ALL PAY, FROM THE CLEANER TO THE
                        CHIEF EXECUTIVE.

                   BUILDING ON THE BEST OF THE NHS
                   THE NHS NEEDS TO BE STRENGTHENED AND IMPROVED.

                   WE WILL:

                      * CUT WAITING LISTS. WE WILL CUT WAITING TIMES BETWEEN
                        DIAGNOSIS AND TREATMENT TO A MAXIMUM OF 6 MONTHS OVER 3
                        YEARS.
                      * IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF CARE AND RAISE MORALE. WE WILL
                        RECRUIT AND TRAIN MORE PROFESSIONAL STAFF. OUR CAREFULLY
                        COSTED PLANS WOULD, FOR INSTANCE, PAY FOR THE EQUIVALENT
                        OF 10,000 MORE NURSES OR 5,000 MORE DOCTORS. WE WILL BAN
                        THE USE OF 'GAGGING CLAUSES' IN EMPLOYMENT CONTRACTS
                        WHICH PREVENT PROFESSIONAL STAFF FROM SPEAKING OUT
                        AGAINST UNSAFE STANDARDS.
                      * TACKLE THE CRISIS IN NHS DENTAL CARE. WE WILL REQUIRE
                        LOCAL AUTHORITIES TO ENSURE THAT THE PUBLIC HAS ACCESS 
TO
                        NHS DENTISTRY IN ALL AREAS.

                   PROMOTING GOOD HEALTH
                   BRITAIN HAS A HEALTH SERVICE THAT CONCENTRATES TOO MUCH ON
                   CURING ILLNESS RATHER THAN PREVENTING IT. A HEALTHIER NATION
                   AND A MORE COST-EFFECTIVE NHS DEPEND ON SHIFTING THE EMPHASIS
                   TOWARDS PREVENTION, TACKLING THE ROOT CAUSES OF ILL HEALTH
                   (E.G. POVERTY AND HOMELESSNESS) AND MAKING PEOPLE MORE
                   RESPONSIBLE FOR THEIR OWN HEALTH.

                   WE WILL:

                      * MAKE PREVENTION A PRIORITY. WE WILL IMMEDIATELY ABOLISH
                        CHARGES FOR EYE AND DENTAL CHECK-UPS AND FREEZE
                        PRESCRIPTION CHARGES AS THE FIRST STEPS IN A RADICAL
                        SHIFT OF POLICY THAT EMPHASISES THE PREVENTION OF 
ILLNESS
                        RATHER THAN TREATMENT.
                      * ENCOURAGE PEOPLE TO TAKE MORE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THEIR
                        OWN HEALTH. WE WILL IMPROVE HEALTH EDUCATION AND PROMOTE
                        HEALTHY LIVING. WE WILL BAN TOBACCO ADVERTISING AND
                        PROMOTION AND INCREASE THE DUTY ON TOBACCO PRODUCTS. WE
                        WILL MAKE THE HEALTH EDUCATION AUTHORITY TRULY
                        INDEPENDENT AND FREE TO CRITICISE GOVERNMENT POLICY.
                      * ENSURE THAT FOOD IS HEALTHY AND SAFE. WE WILL CREATE AN
                        INDEPENDENT AND POWERFUL FOOD COMMISSION, SEPARATE FROM
                        MAFF, AND RESPONSIBLE TO PARLIAMENT FOR FOOD QUALITY AND
                        SAFETY.
                      * PUT HEALTH PROMOTION AT THE HEART OF GOVERNMENT POLICY.
                        WE WILL REQUIRE ALL GOVERNMENT DEPARTMENTS TO ASSESS THE
                        IMPACT OF THEIR POLICIES ON HEALTH. EACH YEAR THERE WILL
                        BE AN INDEPENDENT REPORT, TO BE PUBLISHED AND DEBATED IN
                        PARLIAMENT, ON THE STATE OF THE NATION'S HEALTH.

                   BRINGING HEALTH SERVICES CLOSER TO PEOPLE
                   THE LOCAL INSTITUTIONS OF THE NHS MUST BECOME MORE 
ACCOUNTABLE
                   TO THOSE THEY SERVE AND MORE RESPONSIVE TO PATIENTS' NEEDS.

                   WE WILL:

                      * ENABLE CITIZENS TO PLAY A PART IN SETTING HEALTH 
POLICIES
                        IN THEIR AREA. WE WILL BUILD ON CURRENT PILOT SCHEMES TO
                        BRING TOGETHER HEALTH AUTHORITIES AND SOCIAL SERVICES
                        DEPARTMENTS, WITHIN THE FRAMEWORK OF ELECTED LOCAL
                        AUTHORITIES.
                      * GIVE LOCAL PEOPLE A STRONGER VOICE ON NHS TRUSTS. WE 
WILL
                        END THE RIGHT OF THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR HEALTH TO
                        APPOINT MEMBERS OF NHS TRUSTS, AUTHORITIES AND BOARDS. 
WE
                        WILL REQUIRE AT LEAST HALF THE MEMBERSHIP OF TRUSTS TO 
BE
                        DRAWN FROM THE POPULATION THEY SERVE. WE WILL OPEN UP
                        MEETINGS OF NHS TRUST BOARDS TO THE PUBLIC AND PRESS, 
AND
                        GIVE LOCAL PEOPLE, STAFF AND PROFESSIONALS SPEAKING
                        RIGHTS. WE WILL GUARANTEE DIRECT REPRESENTATION FROM THE
                        STAFF OF EACH TRUST. WE WILL GIVE COMMUNITY HEALTH
                        COUNCILS IMPROVED RIGHTS TO CONSULTATION AND GREATER
                        ACCESS TO INFORMATION AND MEETINGS.
                      * GIVE THE PUBLIC MORE SAY IN SETTING PRIORITIES WITHIN 
THE
                        NHS. DIFFICULT CHOICES ABOUT PRIORITIES MUST BE FACED.
                        THEY CANNOT BE LEFT TO BUREAUCRATS AND HEALTH
                        PROFESSIONALS ALONE. WE WILL DEVELOP NEW WAYS OF
                        INVOLVING THE PUBLIC IN SETTING HEALTH SERVICE
                        PRIORITIES.

                   GIVING PATIENTS MORE CHOICE
                   PATIENTS SHOULD HAVE MORE CHOICE OVER THEIR TYPE OF 
TREATMENT,
                   WHO DELIVERS IT AND WHEN.

                   WE WILL:

                      * ENHANCE THE RIGHTS OF PATIENTS. WE WILL STRENGTHEN THE
                        PATIENTS' CHARTER AND INCLUDE RIGHTS TO TREATMENT WITHIN
                        A SPECIFIED TIME, A CHOICE OF GP, INFORMATION ABOUT THE
                        OPTIONS FOR TREATMENT, GUARANTEED ACCESS TO HEALTH
                        RECORDS AND BETTER REDRESS.
                      * ENSURE THAT ACTION IS TAKEN TO IMPROVE POOR QUALITY
                        SERVICES. WE WILL ENABLE PATIENTS AND STAFF TO APPLY
                        DIRECTLY TO OUR NEW NATIONAL INSPECTORATE OF HEALTH AND
                        SOCIAL CARE TO CARRY OUT INSPECTIONS AND TAKE ACTION
                        WHERE DEFICIENCIES COME TO LIGHT.

                   COMMUNITY CARE
                   OUR AIM IS TO CREATE A SOCIETY IN WHICH PEOPLE, WHATEVER 
THEIR
                   NEEDS, CAN LIVE THEIR LIVES WITH DIGNITY.

                   WE WILL:
                   * GIVE PEOPLE CHOICE IN THE SERVICES THEY USE AND THE WAY 
THEY
                   ARE PROVIDED. WE WILL REQUIRE COUNCILS TO EXTEND TO THOSE 
OVER
                   65 THE RIGHT TO ARRANGE THEIR OWN CARE PRIVATELY, IF THEY
                   WISH. THIS WILL PROMOTE INDEPENDENCE AND ENABLE THEM TO FIND
                   BETTER VALUE FOR MONEY.
                   * CARE FOR CARERS. WE WILL INTRODUCE A NEW CARER'S BENEFIT, 
IN
                   PLACE OF THE INDEPENDENT LIVING ALLOWANCE, IN ORDER TO MEET
                   MORE OF THE FINANCIAL COST OF CARING. WE WILL EXTEND THE
                   CARER'S BENEFIT, AS RESOURCES ALLOW, TO THOSE OVER RETIREMENT
                   AGE AND WORK TO IMPROVE ADVICE, INFORMATION, TRAINING AND
                   COUNSELLING FOR CARERS. WE WILL SEEK TO INCREASE ACCESS TO
                   RESPITE CARE AND ENSURE THAT CARERS AND USERS ARE INVOLVED IN
                   DECISIONS ABOUT CARE. WE WILL DRAW UP A CHARTER THAT SETS OUT
                   CARERS' RIGHTS AND RESPONSIBILITIES.
                   * ESTABLISH HIGH NATIONAL STANDARDS FOR ALL COMMUNITY CARE
                   SERVICES. OUR NEW INDEPENDENT INSPECTORATE OF HEALTH AND
                   SOCIAL CARE WILL PUBLISH CODES OF PRACTICE FOR RESIDENTIAL 
AND
                   NURSING HOMES, AND HAVE THE POWER TO CLOSE ANY HOME THAT
                   CONSISTENTLY FALLS SHORT OF NATIONAL STANDARDS. WE WILL
                   INTRODUCE NATIONAL CHARGING AND ELIGIBILITY GUIDELINES TO
                   ENSURE A 'LEVEL PLAYING FIELD' OF PROVISION AND CHARGES.
                   * PROTECT PEOPLE FROM THE EXCESSIVE COST OF CARE. WE WILL, AS
                   RESOURCES ALLOW, RAISE THE THRESHOLD AT WHICH OLDER PEOPLE 
ARE
                   REQUIRED TO MAKE A CONTRIBUTION TO THEIR LONG-TERM CARE. WE
                   ARE COMMITTED TO WORKING ON A CROSS-PARTY BASIS, TO ESTABLISH
                   A NATIONAL AGREEMENT ON A SYSTEM FOR FUNDING CARE SERVICES
                   THAT DOES NOT PENALISE THRIFT.

OUR AIM: TO RESTORE TRUST IN BRITISH POLITICS.

                    THE PROBLEM: PEOPLE KNOW THAT BRITISH POLITICS ISN'T
                    WORKING. THEIR POLITICIANS HAVE LIED TO THEM, THEIR
                    PARLIAMENT HAS BECOME TAINTED BY SLEAZE AND THEIR
                    GOVERNMENT IS OUT OF TOUCH AND DOESN'T LISTEN.

                    OUR COMMITMENT: LIBERAL DEMOCRATS WILL MODERNISE BRITAIN'S
                    OUTDATED INSTITUTIONS, REBUILD TRUST, RENEW DEMOCRACY AND
                    GIVE BRITAIN'S NATIONS, REGIONS AND LOCAL COMMUNITIES A
                    GREATER SAY OVER THEIR OWN AFFAIRS.

                    
                   OUR PRIORITIES ARE TO:

                      * RESTORE TRUST BETWEEN PEOPLE AND GOVERNMENT, BY ENDING
                        SECRECY AND GUARANTEEING PEOPLES' RIGHTS AND FREEDOMS.
                      * RENEW BRITAIN'S DEMOCRACY, BY CREATING A FAIR VOTING
                        SYSTEM, REFORMING PARLIAMENT AND SETTING HIGHER 
STANDARDS
                        FOR POLITICIANS' CONDUCT.
                      * GIVE GOVERNMENT BACK TO THE PEOPLE, BY DECENTRALISING
                        POWER TO THE NATIONS, REGIONS AND COMMUNITIES OF THE
                        UNITED KINGDOM.

                   RESTORING TRUST IN POLITICS
                   BRITISH POLITICS REMAINS FAR TOO SECRETIVE. WE CANNOT REBUILD
                   TRUST IN POLITICS WITHOUT MAKING GOVERNMENT MORE OPEN AND
                   ACCOUNTABLE.

                   WE WILL:

                      * SAFEGUARD INDIVIDUAL LIBERTIES, BY ESTABLISHING A BILL 
OF
                        RIGHTS. AS A FIRST STEP, WE WILL INCORPORATE THE 
EUROPEAN
                        CONVENTION ON HUMAN RIGHTS INTO UK LAW SO THAT IT IS
                        ENFORCEABLE BY THE COURTS IN THE UK. WE WILL SET UP A
                        HUMAN RIGHTS COMMISSION TO STRENGTHEN THE PROTECTION OF
                        INDIVIDUAL RIGHTS. WE WILL CREATE A MINISTRY FOR JUSTICE
                        RESPONSIBLE FOR PROTECTING HUMAN RIGHTS AND OVERSEEING
                        THE ADMINISTRATION OF THE LEGAL SYSTEM, THE COURTS AND
                        LEGAL AID. WE OPPOSE THE INTRODUCTION OF IDENTITY CARDS.
                      * BREAK OPEN THE EXCESSIVE SECRECY OF GOVERNMENT, BY
                        PASSING A FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT ESTABLISHING A
                        CITIZENS RIGHT TO KNOW.
                      * CUT BACK THE QUANGO STATE WE WILL SCRAP UNNECESSARY
                        QUANGOS, HANDING THEIR FUNCTIONS OVER TO ELECTED BODIES.
                        WE WILL REQUIRE THOSE THAT REMAIN TO MEET IN PUBLIC AND
                        TO LIST THEIR MEMBERS' INTERESTS. WE WILL ESTABLISH A
                        FAIR, OPEN AND MORE REPRESENTATIVE APPOINTMENT PROCESS
                        FOR ALL QUANGOS.
                      * GIVE PEOPLE MORE SAY IN DECISION-MAKING. WE WILL MAKE
                        GREATER USE OF NATIONAL REFERENDUMS FOR CONSTITUTIONAL
                        ISSUES, FOR EXAMPLE, CHANGING THE VOTING SYSTEM OR ANY
                        FURTHER TRANSFER OF POWER TO EUROPEAN INSTITUTIONS. WE
                        WILL ENABLE REFERENDUMS TO BE HELD ON SPECIFIC LOCAL
                        ISSUES WHERE THERE IS PUBLIC DEMAND.

                   RENEWING DEMOCRACY
                   BRITAIN'S POLITICAL INSTITUTIONS ARE OUTDATED AND
                   UNREPRESENTATIVE.

                   WE WILL:

                      * MODERNISE THE HOUSE OF COMMONS. WE WILL REDUCE THE 
NUMBER
                        OF MPS BY 200 (ONE THIRD) AND INTRODUCE TOUGHER RULES 
FOR
                        THEIR CONDUCT, BEHAVIOUR AND OUTSIDE SOURCES OF INCOME.
                        WE WILL IMPROVE DRAFTING AND CONSULTATION ON 
LEGISLATION,
                        AND STRENGTHEN MPS' ABILITY TO HOLD THE GOVERNMENT TO
                        ACCOUNT.
                      * CREATE AN EFFECTIVE AND DEMOCRATIC UPPER HOUSE. WE WILL,
                        OVER TWO PARLIAMENTS, TRANSFORM THE HOUSE OF LORDS INTO 
A
                        PREDOMINANTLY ELECTED SECOND CHAMBER CAPABLE OF
                        REPRESENTING THE NATIONS AND REGIONS OF THE UK AND OF
                        PLAYING A KEY ROLE IN SCRUTINISING EUROPEAN LEGISLATION.
                      * INTRODUCE A FAIR SYSTEM OF VOTING. WE WILL INTRODUCE
                        PROPORTIONAL REPRESENTATION FOR ALL ELECTIONS, TO PUT
                        MORE POWER IN THE HANDS OF VOTERS AND MAKE GOVERNMENT
                        MORE REPRESENTATIVE.
                      * MAKE POLITICS MORE STABLE. WE WILL ESTABLISH A FIXED
                        PARLIAMENTARY TERM OF FOUR YEARS.
                      * CLEAN UP PARTY FUNDING. WE WILL REFORM THE WAY POLITICAL
                        PARTIES ARE FUNDED AND LIMIT THE AMOUNT THEY CAN SPEND 
ON
                        NATIONAL ELECTION CAMPAIGNS. WE WILL MAKE EACH PARTY
                        PUBLISH ITS ACCOUNTS AND LIST ALL LARGE DONORS.

                   GIVING GOVERNMENT BACK TO THE PEOPLE
                   FAR TOO MUCH POWER HAS BEEN CONCENTRATED IN WESTMINSTER AND
                   WHITEHALL. DEMOCRATIC GOVERNMENT SHOULD BE AS CLOSE TO
                   ORDINARY PEOPLE AS POSSIBLE.

                   WE WILL:

                      * INTRODUCE HOME RULE FOR SCOTLAND, WITH THE CREATION OF A
                        SCOTTISH PARLIAMENT, ELECTED BY PROPORTIONAL
                        REPRESENTATION, AND ABLE TO RAISE AND REDUCE INCOME TAX.
                      * INTRODUCE HOME RULE FOR WALES, WITH THE CREATION OF A
                        WELSH SENEDD, ELECTED BY PROPORTIONAL REPRESENTATION, 
AND
                        ABLE TO RAISE AND REDUCE INCOME TAX.
                      * CREATE THE FRAMEWORK TO MAKE EXISTING REGIONAL
                        DECISION-MAKING IN ENGLAND DEMOCRATICALLY ACCOUNTABLE,
                        AND ENABLE THE ESTABLISHMENT OF ELECTED REGIONAL
                        ASSEMBLIES, WHERE THERE IS DEMONSTRATED PUBLIC DEMAND. 
WE
                        WILL CREATE A STRATEGIC AUTHORITY FOR LONDON.
                      * STRENGTHEN LOCAL GOVERNMENT. WE WILL ESTABLISH A 'POWER
                        OF GENERAL COMPETENCE', GIVING COUNCILS WIDER SCOPE FOR
                        ACTION. WE WILL ALLOW LOCAL AUTHORITIES TO RAISE MORE OF
                        THEIR FUNDS LOCALLY, GIVE THEM GREATER DISCRETION OVER
                        SPENDING AND ALLOW THEM, WITHIN STRICT LIMITS, TO GO
                        DIRECTLY TO THE MARKETS TO RAISE FINANCE FOR CAPITAL
                        PROJECTS. WE WILL, IN THE LONG-TERM REPLACE COUNCIL TAX
                        WITH A LOCAL INCOMETAX, AND REPLACE THE UNIFORM BUSINESS
                        RATE WITH A FAIRER SYSTEM OF BUSINESS RATES, RAISED
                        THROUGH LOCAL COUNCILS AND SET IN ACCORDANCE WITH LOCAL
                        PRIORITIES.

                   NORTHERN IRELAND
                   PEACE IN NORTHERN IRELAND DEPENDS ON CONTAINING AND 
ULTIMATELY
                   REMOVING THE ENTRENCHED HOSTILITY BETWEEN THE TWO MAIN
                   COMMUNITIES IN NORTHERN IRELAND.

                   WE WILL:

                      * ESTABLISH A POWER-SHARING EXECUTIVE FOR NORTHERN 
IRELAND,
                        ELECTED UNDER A FAIR AND PROPORTIONAL SYSTEM OF VOTING.
                        WE WILL PRESS FOR A NEW CONSTITUTIONAL SETTLEMENT BASED
                        ON THE PROTECTION OF INDIVIDUAL RIGHTS THROUGH A BILL OF
                        RIGHTS, INCORPORATING THE EUROPEAN CONVENTION.
                      * GIVE INDIVIDUALS MORE POWER AND POLITICAL 
RESPONSIBILITY.
                        WE WILL INTRODUCE A FAIR AND PROPORTIONAL VOTING SYSTEM
                        FOR ALL ELECTIONS, AND REFORM AND STRENGTHEN LOCAL
                        GOVERNMENT IN THE PROVINCE.
                      * ENSURE RESPECT FOR CIVIL LIBERTIES. WE WILL INTRODUCE AN
                        INDEPENDENT PROCEDURE FOR INVESTIGATING COMPLAINTS
                        AGAINST THE SECURITY FORCES, AND REFORM THE DIPLOCK
                        SYSTEM SO THAT THREE JUDGES INSTEAD OF ONE PRESIDE OVER
                        NON-JURY TRIALS. WE WILL URGENTLY IMPLEMENT THE NORTH
                        REPORT'S RECOMMENDATIONS FOR AN INDEPENDENT COMMISSION 
TO
                        SUPERVISE PARADES AND MARCHES.
                      * PROMOTE ECONOMIC GROWTH. WE WILL STRENGTHEN THE
                        ALL-IRELAND ECONOMY THROUGH THE CREATION OF EFFECTIVE
                        CROSS-BORDER AGENCIES. WE WILL INVEST IN EDUCATION AND
                        PROMOTE INWARD INVESTMENT.
                      * BUILD ON THE JOINT DECLARATION AND THE FRAMEWORK
                        DOCUMENT, BY WORKING WITH THE IRISH GOVERNMENT TO CREATE
                        AGREEMENT BETWEEN AS MANY OF THE CONSTITUTIONAL PARTIES
                        AS POSSIBLE. SINN FEIN CAN ONLY BE ADMITTED TO THIS
                        PROCESS IF, IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE MITCHELL PRINCIPLES,
                        THEY AND THE IRA TURN THEIR BACKS ON TERRORISM.
                        MEANWHILE, WE MUST REMAIN VIGILANT AND KEEP IN PLACE THE
                        PRESENT MEANS FOR COUNTERING TERRORISM.

OUR AIM: TO WIDEN OPPORTUNITIES FOR EVERYONE IN BRITAIN TO
                    MAKE THE MOST OF THEIR LIVES.

                    THE PROBLEM: POVERTY, LACK OF TRAINING, LOW PAY AND
                    DISCRIMINATION DENY TOO MANY PEOPLE THE OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE
                    THE MOST OF THEIR LIVES. MEANWHILE, THE WELFARE SYSTEM NO
                    LONGER MEETS THE NEEDS OF A MODERN SOCIETY. IT LOCKS TOO
                    MANY INTO DEPENDENCY AND, TOO OFTEN, PENALISES THOSE WHO
                    WISH TO WORK AND SAVE.

                    OUR COMMITMENT: LIBERAL DEMOCRATS WILL PROMOTE INDIVIDUAL
                    SELF-RELIANCE, STRENGTHEN EQUALITY FOR ALL BEFORE THE LAW
                    AND IN EMPLOYMENT, AND WORK FOR A SOCIETY THAT CHERISHES
                    DIVERSITY.

                    
                   OUR PRIORITIES ARE TO:

                      * ENSURE THAT, BY THE MILLENNIUM, EVERY YOUNG PERSON HAS
                        HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO WORK, LEARN, TRAIN AND MAKE A
                        POSITIVE CONTRIBUTION TO SOCIETY.
                      * GIVE WOMEN GREATER OPPORTUNITIES TO PLAY A FULL ROLE IN
                        WORK AND IN SOCIETY.
                      * ENSURE DIGNITY IN RETIREMENT.
                      * BREAK OPEN THE POVERTY TRAP THAT MAKES PEOPLE BETTER OFF
                        ON THE DOLE THAN IN WORK.
                      * MODERNISE BRITAIN'S WELFARE STATE FOR THE TWENTY-FIRST
                        CENTURY, BUILDING A NEW CROSS-PARTY PARTNERSHIP FOR
                        REFORM.

                   BREAKING THE POVERTY TRAP
                   UNEMPLOYMENT WASTES THE TALENTS AND DENIES PEOPLE THE
                   OPPORTUNITY TO CONTRIBUTE TO THE WELL-BEING OF THEIR FAMILIES
                   AND INCREASE BRITAIN'S WEALTH.

                   WE WILL:

                      * HELP LONG-TERM UNEMPLOYED PEOPLE BACK TO WORK. WE WILL
                        ESTABLISH A SELF-FINANCING BENEFIT TRANSFER PROGRAMME
                        ALLOWING THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN UNEMPLOYED FOR A YEAR OR
                        MORE TO TURN THEIR UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS INTO AN
                        INCENTIVE FOR EMPLOYERS TO RECRUIT AND TRAIN THEM. THE
                        VALUE OF THE BENEFIT TO EMPLOYERS WILL GRADUALLY BE
                        REDUCED.
                      * BREAK OPEN THE POVERTY TRAP. WE WILL TAKE NEARLY 500,000
                        LOW EARNERS OUT OF INCOME TAX ALTOGETHER BY RAISING TAX
                        THRESHOLDS. THIS WILL PROVIDE LOWER TAXES AND NEW
                        INCENTIVES TO WORK, WHILE CUTTING THE BENEFITS BILL AND
                        REDUCING TAX FOR 99.5 PER CENT OF ALL INCOME TAXPAYERS.
                        THIS WILL BE PAID FOR BY INTRODUCING A NEW TOP TAX RATE
                        OF 50P ON TAXABLE INCOME OF OVER £100,000 PER YEAR. WE
                        WILL REPLACE INCOME SUPPORT AND FAMILY CREDIT WITH A
                        SIMPLER, MORE EFFICIENT LOW INCOME BENEFIT THAT 
INCREASES
                        FINANCIAL INCENTIVES FOR PEOPLE GOING BACK TO WORK.
                      * MODERNISE BRITAIN'S WELFARE SYSTEM. WE WILL INITIATE A
                        COMPREHENSIVE REVIEW OF THE WELFARE SYSTEM TO BUILD A 
NEW
                        FRAMEWORK FOR WELFARE AND OPPORTUNITY, ON A CROSS-PARTY
                        BASIS. OUR AIM IS TO PROVIDE A MORE EFFECTIVE SAFETY NET
                        FOR THE DISADVANTAGED, TO ENCOURAGE WORK, WITHOUT
                        COMPULSION, AND TO WIDEN OPPORTUNITIES.
                      * HELP PARENTS TO RETURN TO WORK. WE WILL DEVELOP A
                        NATIONAL CHILDCARE STRATEGY, DRAWING ON PUBLIC AND
                        PRIVATE PROVISION. WE WILL, OVER TIME, EXTEND TAX RELIEF
                        ON WORKPLACE NURSERIES TO OTHER FORMS OF DAY NURSERY
                        CARE.
                      * ESTABLISH A VOLUNTARY CITIZENS SERVICE TO GIVE PEOPLE,
                        ESPECIALLY YOUNG PEOPLE, UP TO 2 YEARS' WORK ON SUCH
                        PROJECTS AS ENVIRONMENTAL CONSERVATION, CRIME 
PREVENTION,
                        HOUSING RENOVATION, SOCIAL SERVICES AND THE ARMED
                        SERVICES.
                      * ENCOURAGE A FLEXIBLE LABOUR MARKET, WHILE PROTECTING THE
                        LOW PAID WITH A REGIONALLY VARIABLE, MINIMUM HOURLY 
RATE.
                      * CRACK DOWN ON SOCIAL SECURITY FRAUD AND TAX EVASION AND
                        SHIFT THE MONEY SAVED INTO NEW POLICIES TO ENHANCE
                        OPPORTUNITIES. WE WILL TACKLE THE HIGH LEVELS OF FRAUD
                        AND OVERPAYMENT IN THE SOCIAL SECURITY BUDGET. WE WILL
                        STOP TAX EVASION AND CLOSE OFF TAX AVOIDANCE LOOPHOLES.

                   OLDER PEOPLE
                   EVERYONE IN BRITAIN SHOULD BE ABLE TO LOOK FORWARD TO A
                   RETIREMENT OF SECURITY, OPPORTUNITY AND DIGNITY. OLD PEOPLE
                   FEEL THAT THEY ARE FAST BECOMING BRITAIN'S FORGOTTEN
                   GENERATION.

                   WE WILL:

                      * GUARANTEE EVERYONE AN ACCEPTABLE MINIMUM STANDARD OF
                        LIVING IN RETIREMENT. WE WILL CREATE AN ADDITIONAL TOP-
UP
                        PENSION FOR PENSIONERS WITH INCOMES BELOW THE INCOME
                        SUPPORT LEVEL. THIS WILL BE INDEXED TO EARNINGS AND
                        TAPERED AS OUTSIDE INCOME INCREASES. THE BASIC STATE
                        PENSION WILL REMAIN INDEXED TO PRICES. WE WILL START TO
                        PHASE OUT THE EXPENSIVE, UNFAIR CONTRIBUTORY SYSTEM AND
                        BASE THE RIGHT TO A STATE PENSION ON CITIZENSHIP AND
                        RESIDENCE.
                      * ENABLE PEOPLE TO CHOOSE WHEN TO START DRAWING A PENSION.
                        WE WILL BRING IN A FLEXIBLE 'DECADE OF RETIREMENT',
                        BETWEEN THE AGES OF 60 AND 70.
                      * PROTECT THE RIGHTS OF OLDER PEOPLE. WE WILL LEGISLATE
                        AGAINST DISCRIMINATION ON THE GROUNDS OF AGE.
                      * EXPAND PRIVATE PENSIONS AND GIVE PEOPLE MORE CONTROL 
OVER
                        THEIR PENSIONS. WE WISH TO SEE MORE PEOPLE MAKING
                        PROVISION FOR THEIR OLD AGE. WE WILL REPLACE THE STATE
                        EARNINGS RELATED SCHEME (SERPS) WITH A SCHEME UNDER 
WHICH
                        ALL EMPLOYEES HAVE PERSONAL OR OCCUPATIONAL PENSIONS.
                        EXISTING ACCRUED SERPS WILL, HOWEVER, BE PRESERVED. WE
                        WILL EXPAND OCCUPATIONAL AND PERSONAL PENSION SCHEMES BY
                        GIVING ALL EMPLOYEES AN ENTITLEMENT TO PARTICIPATE IN A
                        PENSION SCHEME OF THEIR CHOICE, FUNDED BY CONTRIBUTIONS
                        FROM EMPLOYERS AND EMPLOYEES. PENSION RIGHTS WILL BE
                        FULLY SECURED IF PEOPLE CHANGE JOBS. WE WILL TREAT
                        PENSIONS AS DEFERRED INCOME OVER WHICH PENSION-HOLDERS
                        HAVE FULL RIGHTS OF SECURITY, CONTROL AND PORTABILITY.
                      * ABOLISH STANDING CHARGES FOR WATER AND CREATE A FAIRER
                        SYSTEM OF CHARGING.

                   YOUNG PEOPLE
                   WE PROPOSE A NEW DEAL FOR YOUNG PEOPLE, IN WHICH NEW RIGHTS
                   AND NEW RESPONSIBILITIES GO HAND IN HAND.

                   WE WILL:

                      * EXPAND OPPORTUNITIES. OUR AIM IS THAT EVERY YOUNG PERSON
                        BETWEEN THE AGES OF 16 AND 19 WILL HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY
                        TO EITHER WORK, LEARN, TRAIN OR TAKE A PLACE ON OUR NEW
                        CITIZENS SERVICE.
                      * RESTORE SECURITY TO EXCLUDED YOUNG PEOPLE. THE 
WITHDRAWAL
                        OF BENEFIT RIGHTS HAS CONDEMNED THOUSANDS OF YOUNG 
PEOPLE
                        TO LIFE OUT OF WORK AND ON THE STREETS, AT GREAT
                        LONG-TERM PUBLIC COST. WE WILL RESTORE ACCESS TO 
BENEFITS
                        FOR 16 AND 17 YEAR-OLDS. IN THE LONGER TERM, WE AIM TO
                        SCRAP THE LOWER RATE OF INCOME SUPPORT FOR THOSE UNDER
                        25.
                      * ENSURE THAT YOUNG PEOPLE CAN LEARN THEIR RIGHTS AND
                        RESPONSIBILITIES, WITH CITIZENSHIP CLASSES IN EVERY
                        SCHOOL AND PARENTING CLASSES FOR YOUNG ADULTS. WE WILL
                        GIVE CHILDREN AND YOUNG PEOPLE ACCESS TO INFORMATION
                        ABOUT THEIR LEGAL RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS, REVIEW THE AGE
                        OF MAJORITY AND ENSURE THAT YOUNG PEOPLE ARE REPRESENTED
                        ON BODIES THAT ESPECIALLY CONCERN THEM.
                      * EXPAND LOCAL YOUTH SERVICES. WE WILL REQUIRE LOCAL
                        COUNCILS TO PROVIDE A STATUTORY YOUTH SERVICE IN
                        PARTNERSHIP WITH THE VOLUNTARY SECTOR.

                   FAMILIES
                   FAMILIES, IN ALL THEIR FORMS, ARE A BASIC BUILDING BLOCK OF
                   SOCIETY. BUT THE NATURE OF FAMILIES IS CHANGING. THIS HAS
                   BROUGHT NEW STRESSES WHICH MUST BE ADDRESSED. BUT IT HAS ALSO
                   BROUGHT NEW ATTITUDES, SUCH AS THE SHARING OF FAMILY
                   RESPONSIBILITIES, WHICH SHOULD BE ENCOURAGED.

                   WE WILL:

                      * GIVE FAMILIES MORE SECURITY. WE WILL TAKE NEARLY 500,000
                        LOW EARNERS OUT OF TAX ALTOGETHER, BY RAISING TAX
                        THRESHOLDS. WE WILL REPLACE INCOME SUPPORT AND FAMILY
                        CREDIT WITH A SIMPLER, MORE EFFICIENT LOW INCOME BENEFIT
                        THAT HELPS PEOPLE BACK TO WORK. WE AIM TO IMPROVE THE
                        SUPPORT FOR THOSE CARING FOR OLDER PEOPLE AND PEOPLE 
WITH
                        DISABILITIES.
                      * INTRODUCE FAIR AND WORKABLE CHILD SUPPORT LEGISLATION. 
WE
                        WILL REPEAL THE CHILD SUPPORT ACT AND ABOLISH THE CHILD
                        SUPPORT AGENCY. WE BELIEVE THAT PARENTS SHOULD
                        FINANCIALLY SUPPORT THEIR CHILDREN AT AN APPROPRIATE
                        LEVEL. WHERE THERE ARE DISPUTES BETWEEN THE PARENTS,
                        THESE SHOULD BE DECIDED BY THE COURTS, NOT BY AN
                        INFLEXIBLE FORMULA. WE WILL CREATE A NEW SYSTEM OF
                        UNIFIED FAMILY COURTS TO DECIDE THESE QUESTIONS, AFTER
                        THEY HAVE HEARD ALL THE EVIDENCE.
                      * PROMOTE GOOD PARENTING. WE WILL ENCOURAGE THE PROVISION
                        OF PARENTING CLASSES FOR YOUNG ADULTS. WE WILL INCREASE
                        THE ROLE OF PARENTS IN EDUCATION BY EXTENDING
                        HOME/SCHOOL/PUPIL LINKS, AND DEVELOP HOME-SCHOOL
                        PARTNERSHIP ARRANGEMENTS, TO ASSIST IN ADDRESSING THE
                        NEEDS OF THE CHILD.
                      * EXPAND PARENTAL RIGHTS. WE WILL INTRODUCE A STATUTORY
                        RIGHT TO PARENTAL LEAVE AND DEVELOP MATERNITY BENEFIT
                        INTO A NEW, FLEXIBLE PARENTAL BENEFIT TO BE SHARED
                        BETWEEN PARTNERS. WE WILL ENSURE THAT FOSTERING AND
                        ADOPTION LAW IS BASED ON THE SUITABILITY OF PROSPECTIVE
                        FOSTERERS AND THE NEEDS OF THE CHILD.
                      * HELP PARENTS TO RETURN TO WORK. WE WILL, OVER TIME,
                        EXTEND TAX RELIEF ON WORKPLACE NURSERIES TO OTHER FORMS
                        OF DAY NURSERY CARE. WE WILL DEVELOP A NATIONAL 
CHILDCARE
                        STRATEGY, DRAWING ON PUBLIC AND PRIVATE PROVISION.
                      * ENCOURAGE FLEXIBLE WORKING PATTERNS. WE WILL ENCOURAGE
                        JOB SHARING AND FAMILY-FRIENDLY EMPLOYMENT PRACTICES,
                        ESPECIALLY IN THE PUBLIC SECTOR. WE WILL GIVE PRIVATE
                        SECTOR EMPLOYEES APPROACHING RETIREMENT AGE, OR WITH
                        RESPONSIBILITIES FOR YOUNG CHILDREN, THE RIGHT TO
                        NEGOTIATE REDUCED HOURS OR A CAREER BREAK.

                   WOMEN
                   THERE IS STILL A LONG WAY TO GO BEFORE WOMEN IN BRITAIN HAVE
                   EQUAL OPPORTUNITIES.

                   WE WILL:

                      * PROMOTE EQUALITY IN THE WORKPLACE. WE WILL, OVER TIME,
                        EXTEND EMPLOYMENT AND PENSIONS RIGHTS TO PART-TIME
                        EMPLOYEES, ON A PRO-RATA BASIS. WE WILL BRING IN TOUGHER
                        OBLIGATIONS ON EMPLOYERS TO ESTABLISH EQUAL 
OPPORTUNITIES
                        PROCEDURES AND PURSUE THE PRINCIPLE OF EQUAL PAY FOR 
WORK
                        OF EQUAL VALUE.
                      * MAKE PENSIONS FAIRER TO WOMEN, BY WORKING TO REPLACE THE
                        CONTRIBUTORY SYSTEM WITH PENSION RIGHTS BASED ON
                        CITIZENSHIP AND RESIDENCE IN THE UK. WE WILL BRING
                        FORWARD THE INTRODUCTION OF PENSION SPLITTING ON 
DIVORCE.
                      * IMPROVE THE SERVICES THAT WOMEN RECEIVE FROM THE NHS. WE
                        WILL PROMOTE EQUAL TREATMENT OF THE SEXES WITHIN THE
                        HEALTH SERVICE. WE WILL SET TARGETS FOR THE EXPANSION OF
                        FACILITIES WHICH ENABLE WOMEN TO CONSULT FEMALE HEALTH
                        PROFESSIONALS.
                      * MAKE THE LEGAL SYSTEM FAIRER TO WOMEN. WE WILL 
STRENGTHEN
                        THE CIVIL LAW REMEDIES FOR DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AND IMPROVE
                        THE TREATMENT OF RAPE VICTIMS BY THE COURT SYSTEM. WE
                        WILL SEEK TO IMPROVE THE PROVISION OF REFUGE PLACES FOR
                        VICTIMS OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE.
                      * ENHANCE THE ROLE OF WOMEN IN PUBLIC LIFE. WE WILL TACKLE
                        THE UNDER-REPRESENTATION OF WOMEN ON PUBLIC BODIES BY
                        SETTING A TARGET THAT WITHIN A DECADE AT LEAST ONE-THIRD
                        OF ALL THOSE ON ALL PUBLIC BODIES SHOULD BE WOMEN. WE
                        WILL REFORM THE PROCEDURES AND FACILITIES OF THE HOUSE 
OF
                        COMMONS TO MAKE THEM MORE ACCOMMODATING TO WOMEN AND
                        FAMILIES.

                   DISABLED PEOPLE
                   PROGRESS IN EQUAL OPPORTUNITIES FOR DISABLED PEOPLE REMAINS
                   PATCHY AND UNACCEPTABLY SLOW.

                   WE WILL:

                      * GUARANTEE THE RIGHTS OF DISABLED PEOPLE. WE WILL BAN
                        DISCRIMINATION ON THE GROUNDS OF DISABILITY AND PASS
                        COMPREHENSIVE LEGISLATION SECURING THE CIVIL RIGHTS OF
                        DISABLED PEOPLE. WE WILL DRAW UP A CHARTER OF RIGHTS
                        SETTING OUT WHAT OUR NEW BILL OF RIGHTS MEANS FOR
                        DISABLED PEOPLE.
                      * GIVE DISABLED PEOPLE MORE INDEPENDENCE. WE WILL 
INTRODUCE
                        A PARTIAL CAPACITY BENEFIT, BUILDING ON THE DISABILITY
                        WORKING ALLOWANCE, TO ASSIST THOSE IN WORK WHO CANNOT
                        FULLY SUPPORT THEMSELVES FINANCIALLY. WE AIM TO INCREASE
                        FINANCIAL SUPPORT FOR DISABLED PEOPLE WHO CANNOT FIND
                        WORK AND TO MAKE PROVISION FOR THE REAL COSTS OF
                        DISABILITY.
                      * IMPROVE ACCESS. WE WILL PUBLISH A CODE OF PRACTICE TO
                        IMPROVE ACCESS TO BUILDINGS AND TRANSPORT. WE WILL
                        REQUIRE GOVERNMENT DEPARTMENTS, LOCAL COUNCILS AND 
PUBLIC
                        ORGANISATIONS TO MAKE THEIR KEY PUBLIC LITERATURE
                        AVAILABLE IN BRAILLE OR WHERE APPROPRIATE TAPE.
                      * MAKE EDUCATION INCLUSIVE. AS PART OF OUR £2 BILLION
                        INVESTMENT IN EDUCATION, WE WILL INCREASE FUNDING FOR,
                        AND ENFORCE IMPLEMENTATION OF, THE CODE OF PRACTICE FOR
                        SPECIAL EDUCATIONAL NEEDS.

                   ETHNIC MINORITIES
                   DESPITE PROGRESS OVER RECENT YEARS, MEMBERS OF ETHNIC
                   MINORITIES ARE TOO OFTEN DENIED EQUAL OPPORTUNITIES AND HAVE
                   TO FACE RACISM AND DISCRIMINATION ON A DAILY BASIS. 
DIVERSITY,
                   PLURALISM AND A MULTICULTURAL SOCIETY ARE SOURCES OF STRENGTH
                   FOR BRITAIN.

                   WE WILL:

                      * STRENGTHEN ACTION AGAINST DISCRIMINATION. WE WILL CREATE
                        A NEW HUMAN RIGHTS COMMISSION, COMBINING THE COMMISSION
                        FOR RACIAL EQUALITY AND THE EQUAL OPPORTUNITIES
                        COMMISSION. WE WILL GIVE STATUTORY FORCE TO THE
                        COMMISSION FOR RACIAL EQUALITY'S CODE OF PRACTICE IN
                        EMPLOYMENT, AND ENSURE THAT BRITAIN PLAYS A LEADING ROLE
                        IN STRENGTHENING ANTI-DISCRIMINATION LEGISLATION
                        THROUGHOUT THE EUROPEAN UNION.
                      * ENSURE EQUAL OPPORTUNITIES FOR ALL. WE WILL REQUIRE 
LOCAL
                        AUTHORITIES AND HOUSING ASSOCIATIONS TO ENSURE EQUAL
                        OPPORTUNITIES IN HOUSING ALLOCATION. WE WILL EXPAND
                        ACCESS TO MOTHER-TONGUE TEACHING, FOR BOTH ADULTS AND
                        CHILDREN, WHERE THIS TAKES PLACE THROUGH SELF-HELP AND
                        COMMUNITY GROUPS.
                      * FREE IMMIGRATION LAWS FROM RACIAL DISCRIMINATION. WE 
WILL
                        ENSURE THAT IMMIGRATION POLICY IS NON-DISCRIMINATORY IN
                        ITS APPLICATION. WE WILL REFORM CURRENT IMMIGRATION LAWS
                        SO AS TO ENABLE GENUINE FAMILY REUNIONS. WE WILL RESTORE
                        BENEFIT RIGHTS TO ASYLUM SEEKERS AND ENSURE THAT ASYLUM
                        CLAIMS ARE DEALT WITH SWIFTLY.
                      * INCREASE ETHNIC MINORITIES' CONFIDENCE IN THE POLICE. WE
                        WILL ENCOURAGE THE RECRUITMENT OF ETHNIC MINORITIES INTO
                        THE POLICE FORCE AND REQUIRE ACTION TO BE TAKEN AGAINST
                        DISCRIMINATION WITHIN THE FORCE. WE WILL TACKLE ANY
                        DISCRIMINATORY USE OF POLICE POWERS, SUCH AS STOP AND
                        SEARCH, AND ENHANCE POLICE ACTION TO DEAL WITH RACIAL
                        ATTACKS. WE WILL ENCOURAGE THE USE OF AGGRAVATED
                        SENTENCING FOR RACIALLY MOTIVATED CRIMES.

                   LESBIANS AND GAY MEN
                   IN A FREE AND TOLERANT SOCIETY, DISCRIMINATION ON ANY GROUNDS
                   IS UNACCEPTABLE. DIVERSITY IS A SOURCE OF STRENGTH.

                   WE WILL:

                      * ENSURE EQUALITY BEFORE THE LAW FOR LESBIANS AND GAY MEN
                        THROUGH OUR NEW HUMAN RIGHTS COMMISSION AND THE BILL OF
                        RIGHTS. WE WILL CREATE A COMMON AGE OF CONSENT 
REGARDLESS
                        OF GENDER OR SEXUAL ORIENTATION.
                      * STOP DISCRIMINATION. WE WILL OUTLAW INCITEMENT TO HATRED
                        AND DISCRIMINATION IN HOUSING AND EMPLOYMENT, INCLUDING
                        THE ARMED FORCES, ON GROUNDS OF SEXUAL ORIENTATION. WE
                        WILL REPEAL 'SECTION 28' OF THE 1988 LOCAL GOVERNMENT
                        ACT. WE WILL REFORM THE LAW, ENSURE THAT THE POLICE AND
                        LOCAL AUTHORITIES DEAL MORE EFFECTIVELY WITH HOMOPHOBIC
                        ATTACKS, AND ENCOURAGE POLICE FORCES TO BE MORE
                        REPRESENTATIVE OF THE COMMUNITIES THEY SERVE.

OUR AIM: TO RECAST BRITAIN'S FOREIGN POLICY AND ENABLE THIS
                    COUNTRY TO PLAY A LEADING ROLE IN SHAPING EUROPE AND
                    STRENGTHENING INTERNATIONAL INSTITUTIONS.

                    THE PROBLEM: FOR TOO LONG BRITISH FOREIGN POLICY HAS LOOKED
                    BACKWARDS TO ITS IMPERIAL PAST. BRITAIN'S INTERESTS HAVE
                    BEEN DAMAGED BY AN ATTITUDE TO EUROPE THAT HAS BEEN, AT
                    BEST, AMBIVALENT AND, AT WORST, HOSTILE. THIS ATTITUDE HAS
                    ALSO COST BRITAIN OPPORTUNITIES FOR INFLUENCE AND
                    ADVANTAGE.

                    OUR COMMITMENT: LIBERAL DEMOCRATS WILL ENSURE THAT BRITAIN
                    PLAYS A LEADING ROLE IN SHAPING EUROPE, DEMOCRATISING ITS
                    INSTITUTIONS AND STRENGTHENING ITS ROLE AS A FRAMEWORK FOR
                    PROSPERITY, PEACE AND SECURITY. BRITAIN, WITH ITS WORLD
                    EXPERIENCE, EXPERT ARMED FORCES AND PERMANENT MEMBERSHIP OF
                    THE UN SECURITY COUNCIL, HAS A UNIQUE ROLE TO PLAY IN
                    REFORMING INTERNATIONAL INSTITUTIONS FOR THE NEXT CENTURY.

                    
                   OUR PRIORITIES ARE TO:

                      * MAKE THE EUROPEAN UNION (EU) WORK MORE EFFECTIVELY AND
                        DEMOCRATISE ITS INSTITUTIONS.
                      * WIDEN EUROPE TO INCLUDE THE NEW DEMOCRACIES OF CENTRAL
                        AND EASTERN EUROPE.
                      * CREATE A STRONG FRAMEWORK FOR BRITAIN'S DEFENCE AND
                        SECURITY THROUGH NATO AND EUROPEAN CO-OPERATION.
                      * GIVE BRITAIN A LEADING ROLE IN REFORMING AND
                        STRENGTHENING THE UN AND OTHER INTERNATIONAL
                        INSTITUTIONS.
                      * PROMOTE AN ENFORCEABLE FRAMEWORK FOR INTERNATIONAL LAW,
                        HUMAN RIGHTS AND THE PROTECTION OF THE ENVIRONMENT.

                   POSITIVE LEADERSHIP IN EUROPE
                   BRITAIN'S INTERESTS CAN ONLY BEST BE PURSUED THROUGH
                   CONSTRUCTIVE PARTICIPATION IN AN ENLARGED EUROPEAN UNION. OUR
                   VISION IS OF A EUROPEAN UNION THAT IS DECENTRALISED,
                   DEMOCRATIC AND DIVERSE. A STRONG AND UNITED EUROPE, BUT ONE
                   THAT RESPECTS CULTURAL TRADITIONS AND NATIONAL AND REGIONAL
                   IDENTITIES.

                   IN SEEKING TO REFORM THE EU, OUR PRIORITIES ARE TO:

                      * GIVE THE BRITISH PEOPLE A SAY. REFORM THAT FUNDAMENTALLY
                        CHANGES BRITAIN'S PLACE IN EUROPE SHOULD ONLY PROCEED IF
                        IT HAS THE EXPLICIT SUPPORT OF BRITAIN'S PEOPLE. IF 
THERE
                        IS ANY SUBSTANTIAL CHANGE IN BRITAIN'S RELATIONSHIP WITH
                        THE EU, THE BRITISH PEOPLE MUST GIVE THEIR CONSENT
                        THROUGH A REFERENDUM.
                      * MAKE EU INSTITUTIONS MORE DEMOCRATIC AND ACCOUNTABLE. WE
                        WILL GIVE THE HOUSE OF COMMONS A MORE EFFECTIVE ROLE IN
                        SCRUTINISING EUROPEAN POLICY. WE ALSO WANT THE COUNCIL 
OF
                        MINISTERS AND THE EC COMMISSION TO BE MORE ACCOUNTABLE 
TO
                        THE ELECTED EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT. WE WILL INTRODUCE A 
FAIR
                        AND PROPORTIONAL VOTING SYSTEM FOR BRITISH MEPS IN TIME
                        FOR THE 1999 EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT ELECTIONS.
                      * MAKE EU DECISION-MAKING MORE EFFICIENT AND EFFECTIVE.
                        EUROPE CANNOT EFFECTIVELY ENLARGE WITHOUT IMPROVING ITS
                        DECISION-MAKING. WE THEREFORE FAVOUR THE WIDER
                        APPLICATION OF MAJORITY VOTING. BUT WE WILL KEEP THE 
VETO
                        ON ALL ISSUES RELATING TO THE CONSTITUTION, BUDGETARY
                        MATTERS AND REGULATIONS ON PAY AND SOCIAL SECURITY. WE
                        SUPPORT THE USE OF THE 'DOUBLE MAJORITY', ESPECIALLY ON
                        MATTERS SUCH AS FOREIGN AND SECURITY POLICY. EACH MEMBER
                        STATE MUST RETAIN THE UNFETTERED RIGHT TO MAKE ITS OWN
                        DECISIONS ON THE COMMITMENT OF ITS NATIONAL TROOPS.

                   PURSUING BRITAIN'S INTERESTS IN EUROPE
                   BRITAIN HAS MUCH TO GAIN FROM EU MEMBERSHIP. THIS WILL TAKE
                   NEW LEADERSHIP, A NEW APPROACH AND A RENEWED SENSE OF 
NATIONAL
                   CONFIDENCE.

                   OUR AIMS IN EUROPE ARE TO:

                      * ENHANCE ECONOMIC PROSPERITY, BY PROMOTING THE FREEDOM OF
                        MOVEMENT OF PEOPLE, GOODS, SERVICES AND MONEY THROUGHOUT
                        THE EU AND BY COMPLETING THE EUROPEAN SINGLE MARKET,
                        PARTICULARLY IN AREAS OF FINANCIAL SERVICES, PENSIONS 
AND
                        AIR TRAVEL.
                      * PARTICIPATE IN A SUCCESSFUL SINGLE CURRENCY. BEING PART
                        OF A SUCCESSFUL SINGLE CURRENCY WILL BRING LOW INFLATION
                        AND LOW INTEREST RATES. STAYING OUT WILL RESULT IN LESS
                        INVESTMENT AND A LOSS OF INFLUENCE. HOWEVER, THREE
                        CONDITIONS MUST BE MET BEFORE BRITAIN CAN JOIN. FIRST,
                        THE SINGLE CURRENCY MUST BE FIRMLY FOUNDED ON THE
                        MAASTRICHT CRITERIA. SECOND, BRITAIN MUST MEET THOSE
                        CRITERIA. THIRD, THE BRITISH PEOPLE MUST HAVE AGREED TO
                        IT IN A REFERENDUM.
                      * STRENGTHEN THE EUROPEAN FRAMEWORK FOR PEACE AND 
SECURITY.
                        BRITAIN'S SECURITY AND NATIONAL INTERESTS ARE BEST
                        PURSUED IN PARTNERSHIP WITH ITS EUROPEAN NEIGHBOURS. WE
                        WILL WORK TO STRENGTHEN EUROPEAN COMMON FOREIGN AND
                        SECURITY POLICY TO ENABLE GREATER SCOPE FOR UNITED
                        EUROPEAN ACTION. INDIVIDUAL MEMBER STATES MUST BE FREE 
TO
                        DECIDE WHETHER OR NOT THEIR NATIONAL FORCES WILL TAKE
                        PART IN ANY PARTICULAR ACTION.
                      * FIGHT CRIME AND PROTECT CITIZENS' RIGHTS THROUGH MORE
                        EFFECTIVE CO-OPERATION BETWEEN EU STATES' POLICE AND
                        CUSTOMS FORCES WITH GREATER DEMOCRATIC ACCOUNTABILITY. 
WE
                        WILL WORK TO IMPROVE EUROPEAN CO-OPERATION AGAINST
                        CROSS-BORDER CRIMINAL ACTIVITY AND ALLOW FREE MOVEMENT
                        FOR BRITAIN'S PEOPLE THROUGHOUT EUROPE. THE
                        ADMINISTRATION OF BORDER CONTROLS SHOULD REMAIN WITH
                        INDIVIDUAL MEMBER NATIONS UNTIL THEY CAN BE CONFIDENT
                        THAT THE EU'S EXTERNAL BORDERS ARE SECURE.
                      * REFORM THE COMMON AGRICULTURAL POLICY, CONVERTING IT 
INTO
                        A SYSTEM OF DIRECT PAYMENTS TO SUPPORT ECONOMIC, SOCIAL
                        AND ENVIRONMENTAL GOALS IN RURAL COMMUNITIES.
                      * REFORM FISHERIES POLICIES, SCRAPPING THE COMMON 
FISHERIES
                        POLICY AND REPLACING IT WITH A NEW EUROPE-WIDE FISHERIES
                        POLICY BASED ON THE REGIONAL MANAGEMENT OF FISH STOCKS.
                        WE WILL TAKE URGENT ACTION TO END QUOTA-HOPPING AND 
BEGIN
                        THE PHASED ABOLITION OF INDUSTRIAL FISHING.

                   STRONG DEFENCE IN AN UNCERTAIN WORLD
                   THE FIRST DECADES OF THE NEXT CENTURY ARE LIKELY TO BE
                   TURBULENT AND UNSTABLE EVERYWHERE, INCLUDING WITHIN AND 
AROUND
                   EUROPE. BRITAIN MUST MAINTAIN AN EFFECTIVE SECURITY
                   CAPABILITY. THIS WILL BEST BE ACHIEVED THROUGH NATO AND
                   EUROPEAN CO-OPERATION, AND THIS COUNTRY MUST CONTINUE TO PLAY
                   A FULL PART IN BOTH.

                   WE WILL:

                      * MAINTAIN A STRONG DEFENCE AT HOME AND ENABLE THE UK TO
                        PLAY A LEADING ROLE IN KEEPING INTERNATIONAL PEACE. WE
                        WILL MAINTAIN BRITAIN'S OVERALL DEFENCE CAPABILITY AT 
ITS
                        CURRENT LEVEL, WHILST ENSURING UK FORCES MEET CURRENT
                        NEEDS AND ARE APPROPRIATE TO POTENTIAL THREATS.
                      * RETAIN BRITAIN'S BASIC NUCLEAR CAPABILITY THROUGH THE
                        TRIDENT SUBMARINE FORCE UNTIL SUCH TIME AS INTERNATIONAL
                        MULTILATERAL NUCLEAR DISARMAMENT CAN BE ACHIEVED. WE 
WILL
                        RESTRICT THE NUMBER OF NUCLEAR WARHEADS ON TRIDENT TO 
THE
                        SAME NUMBER AS PREVIOUSLY DEPLOYED ON POLARIS.
                      * RESIST THE PROLIFERATION OF WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION.
                        WE WILL PRESS FOR THE CONCLUSION OF A VERIFIABLE
                        COMPREHENSIVE TEST BAN TREATY. WE WILL ENSURE THAT
                        BRITAIN PLAYS AN ACTIVE PART IN TALKS TO REDUCE THE
                        HOLDINGS OF STRATEGIC NUCLEAR WEAPONS.
                      * SUPPORT THE PRINCIPLE OF COMMON SECURITY. WE SUPPORT THE
                        EXTENSION OF THE SECURITY GUARANTEES, FROM WHICH WESTERN
                        EUROPE HAS BENEFITED, TO THE NEW DEMOCRACIES OF CENTRAL
                        AND EASTERN EUROPE. WE SUPPORT NATO AND ITS ENLARGEMENT.

                   WORKING FOR PEACE, SECURITY AND SUSTAINABILITY
                   IN AN INCREASINGLY INTER-DEPENDENT WORLD, THE SECURITY OF A
                   MEDIUM SIZED NATION LIKE BRITAIN IS BEST PRESERVED WITHIN A
                   FRAMEWORK OF INTERNATIONAL LAW THAT IS EFFECTIVE AND
                   ENFORCEABLE.

                   REFORMING THE UNITED NATIONS
                   PLAYING A LEADING ROLE IN STRENGTHENING AND REFORMING THE
                   UNITED NATIONS SHOULD BE A CENTRAL ASPECT OF BRITAIN'S 
FOREIGN
                   POLICY OVER THE NEXT DECADE.

                   WE WILL WORK TO:

                      * STRENGTHEN THE UN'S PEACEKEEPING CAPABILITY SO THAT IT
                        CAN TAKE EARLIER AND MORE EFFECTIVE ACTION TO PREVENT OR
                        SUPPRESS CONFLICT. THIS SHOULD INCLUDE ESTABLISHING FAST
                        TRACK MACHINERY FOR NEGOTIATIONS; PERMANENT, ON-CALL,
                        PEACEKEEPING FORCES MADE UP FROM HIGH-CALIBRE TROOPS
                        PROVIDED BY MEMBER STATES; THE REINSTATEMENT OF A
                        MILITARY STAFF COMMITTEE; THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A UN 
STAFF
                        COLLEGE TO TRAIN OFFICERS; AND IMPROVEMENTS TO THE UN'S
                        COMMAND CONTROL, COMMUNICATION AND INTELLIGENCE
                        CAPABILITIES.
                      * SUPPORT THE ESTABLISHMENT OF AN INTERNATIONAL CRIMINAL
                        COURT TO DEAL WITH GENOCIDE AND WAR CRIMES.

                   PROTECTING THE GLOBAL ENVIRONMENT
                   POLLUTION AND ENVIRONMENTAL DEGRADATION DO NOT RESPECT
                   NATIONAL BORDERS. COUNTRIES MUST WORK TOGETHER IF THE WORLD'S
                   ENVIRONMENT IS TO BE PROTECTED.

                   WE WILL:

                      * TAKE A LEAD IN INTERNATIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL NEGOTIATIONS.
                        WE WILL PRESS FOR TOUGH AND LEGALLY BINDING 
INTERNATIONAL
                        TARGETS FOR GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS AND OTHER
                        POLLUTANTS.
                      * DEVELOP A GLOBAL SYSTEM OF ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION. WE
                        WILL WORK FOR THE CREATION OF A GLOBAL ENVIRONMENTAL
                        ORGANISATION. WE WILL PROMOTE AN ENVIRONMENTAL 
EQUIVALENT
                        OF THE GENEVA CONVENTION, TO OUTLAW GROSS ACTS OF
                        ENVIRONMENTAL DESTRUCTION IN TIMES OF WAR.

                   TACKLING WORLD POVERTY
                   THE ELIMINATION OF GLOBAL FAMINE, PESTILENCE AND POVERTY IS
                   NOT ONLY A MORAL CHALLENGE, IT IS ALSO ESSENTIAL FOR THE
                   WORLD'S LONG-TERM STABILITY AND PEACE.

                   WE WILL:

                      * INCREASE BRITAIN'S CONTRIBUTION TO OVERSEAS AID. WE WILL
                        SET OUT A TIMETABLE FOR SUSTAINED PROGRESS TOWARDS
                        ACHIEVING THE UN TARGET FOR OVERSEAS DEVELOPMENT AID OF
                        0.7 PER CENT OF GNP WITHIN THE NEXT 10 YEARS.
                      * PROMOTE A TIMETABLE FOR DEBT RELIEF TO THE POOREST 
STATES
                        INCLUDING A PROGRAMME FOR CANCELLING DEBT AND THE
                        CREATION OF NEW AND ADDITIONAL RESOURCES FOR DEBT 
RELIEF.
                      * TARGET BRITAIN'S BILATERAL AID WHERE IT IS MOST NEEDED.
                        WE WILL FOCUS BRITAIN'S BILATERAL AID ON THE LEAST
                        DEVELOPED COUNTRIES AND END THE PRACTICE OF TYING AID.
                      * REQUIRE STATES THAT RECEIVE UK DEVELOPMENT ASSISTANCE TO
                        RESPECT THE FUNDAMENTAL HUMAN RIGHTS OF THEIR PEOPLE AND
                        SUSPEND UK PROGRAMMES WHERE THESE STANDARDS ARE 
BREACHED.

                   CONTROLLING ARMS SALES
                   THE GLOBAL ARMS TRADE FUELS CONFLICTS, HINDERS PROSPERITY AND
                   ROBS THE WORLD'S POOR OF RESOURCES. ITS GROWTH MUST BE
                   DIMINISHED.

                   WE WILL:

                      * END THE SALE OF BRITISH ARMS, WAR MATERIAL, AND 'DUAL
                        USE' TECHNOLOGIES TO REGIMES WHICH ABUSE HUMAN RIGHTS,
                        AND STRICTLY CONTROL ARMS SALES TO REGIONS OF TENSION OR
                        POTENTIAL CONFLICT.
                      * SEEK A NEW INTERNATIONAL REGIME TO CONTROL THE ARMS
                        TRADE. WE WILL SUPPORT TIGHTER EU-WIDE RESTRICTIONS ON
                        TRANSFERS OF MILITARY TECHNOLOGY TO NON-DEMOCRATIC
                        REGIMES AND PRESS FOR THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A MANDATORY 
UN
                        REGISTER, IN WHICH ALL ARMS SALES AND TRANSFERS MUST BE
                        LISTED.
                      * BAN LANDMINES. WE WILL PLACE AN IMMEDIATE AND TOTAL BAN
                        ON THE PRODUCTION, STOCKPILING AND EXPORT OF
                        ANTI-PERSONNEL LANDMINES AND WORK TOWARDS A GLOBAL BAN 
ON
                        LANDMINE PRODUCTION.

                   FREE AND FAIR TRADE
                   FREE AND FAIR TRADE BENEFITS ALL. THE GATT URUGUAY ROUND HAS
                   SUCCESSFULLY LOWERED BARRIERS TO INTERNATIONAL TRADE, BUT
                   FURTHER REFORMS ARE NEEDED.

                   WE WILL SEEK ACTION TO:

                      * ENHANCE FREE TRADE BY FURTHER REDUCING TARIFF AND
                        NON-TARIFF BARRIERS, ESPECIALLY AGAINST THE POOREST
                        COUNTRIES.
                      * IMPROVE GLOBAL LABOUR STANDARDS BY PERMITTING COUNTRIES
                        TO DISCRIMINATE AGAINST GOODS PRODUCED BY NATIONS THAT
                        MAINTAIN PRACTICES SUCH AS CHILD, SLAVE AND FORCED
                        LABOUR. WE WILL SUPPORT THE WORK OF THE INTERNATIONAL
                        LABOUR ORGANISATION IN RAISING LABOUR STANDARDS
                        THROUGHOUT THE WORLD.
                      * ADVANCE ENVIRONMENTAL OBJECTIVES. WE SUPPORT THE 
ADDITION
                        OF AN ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY CLAUSE TO THE GATT,
                        SETTING OUT AGREED PRINCIPLES OF ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY
                        AGAINST WHICH TRADE MEASURES CAN BE JUDGED.
                      * REDUCE TRANS-NATIONAL CORPORATIONS' ABILITY TO ABUSE
                        MARKET POWER, THROUGH THE DEVELOPMENT OF A FRAMEWORK FOR
                        GLOBAL COMPETITION POLICY.

A COPY OF OUR ANNUAL TAX CONTRACT WILL BE DELIVERED TO EACH UK
                   HOUSEHOLD FOLLOWING THE BUDGET EACH YEAR. SOME OF THE
                   INFORMATION WHICH WOULD BE INCLUDED IS PROVIDED HERE.

                   THIS ANNUAL TAX CONTRACT WILL BE IN KEEPING WITH OUR FOUR TAX
                   PLEDGES:

                     1. NO TAXATION WITHOUT EXPLANATION
                        CENTRAL GOVERNMENT SHOULD INFORM TAXPAYERS OF THE WAYS 
IN
                        WHICH THEIR MONEY IS RAISED AND SPENT, JUST AS LOCAL
                        COUNCILS NOW DO.
                     2. NO PROMISES UNLESS THE BILL IS ATTACHED
                        PEOPLE HAVE THE RIGHT TO KNOW THE GOVERNMENT'S 
PRIORITIES
                        AND HOW MUCH THEY WILL COST. WHEN WE MAKE SIGNIFICANT
                        CHANGES IN OUR TAX AND SPENDING PRIORITIES WE WILL TELL
                        PEOPLE WHERE THE MONEY HAS COME FROM. WE WILL ASK THE
                        NATIONAL AUDIT OFFICE TO MAKE SURE THAT ADDITIONAL
                        EXPENDITURE EARMARKED FOR SPECIFIC PROJECTS IS SPENT
                        ACCORDINGLY.
                     3. NO MORE TAX WITHOUT TACKLING WASTE
                        EACH YEAR WE WILL SET OUT THE MEASURES WHICH WE PLAN TO
                        IMPLEMENT IN ORDER TO REDUCE WASTEFUL EXPENDITURE AND
                        DELIVER BEST VALUE FOR MONEY TO TAXPAYERS. WE WILL NEVER
                        RAISE TAXES WITHOUT FIRST SCRUTINISING GOVERNMENT
                        EXPENDITURE FOR WASTE.
                     4. FAIR TAX FOR ALL
                        TAX BANDS, RATES AND RELIEFS SHOULD ENSURE THAT EVERYONE
                        CONTRIBUTES ACCORDING TO THEIR ABILITY TO PAY AND THAT 
THE
                        TAX BURDEN IS FAIRLY SHARED. WE WILL AIM TO TAKE MORE OF
                        THOSE ON LOW INCOMES OUT OF TAX COMPLETELY. WE WILL 
CLAMP
                        DOWN ON TAX AVOIDANCE AND EVASION. WE WILL PROVIDE A
                        MECHANISM FOR PEOPLE TO GIVE THEIR VIEWS ON TAX AND
                        SPENDING PRIORITIES.
