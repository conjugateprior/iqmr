The sub-paragraph seeks to enable the doctor to make a judgment not about the guilt of the assailant, but about whether the woman is entitled to relief, provided that the complaint is made immediately and, as it would have to be in practice, well before pregnancy is established. That might preclude some bogus complaints, but it is still open to considerable practical objection. It may be that in Committee these practical difficulties can be overcome, or it may be that in most genuine cases of rape there will be other grounds already covered in the Bill for terminating the pregnancy.
