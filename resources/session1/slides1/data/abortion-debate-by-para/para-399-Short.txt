My hon. Friend the Member for Pontypool (Mr. Abse), in a characteristically energetic and lively, though perhaps not very helpful contribution, drew attention to the dangers that can occur from this operation and the psychiatric disturbance that occurs after termination. I suggest that a good deal of the psychological disturbance that occurs on occasion after termination is due to the attitude of society to this problem and that this is inculcated when the unfortunate patient goes to hospital and finds that she is attended by doctors and nurses who disapprove on religious grounds and make her feel that she is guilty of a criminal offence.
