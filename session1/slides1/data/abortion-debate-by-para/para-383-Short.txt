The House should accept it as a basic fact that if a woman is so desperate that she believes that she must terminate her pregnancy, she will go to all lengths to do so and that whatever the House decides today, abortions will continue.

Members ask for more information or suggest that we should have a Royal Commission, I ask them, in return, what the delay would produce and what further information we would get.
