We have had evidence over many years, and from many different bodies, of the need and support of the country for a change of the law. As my right hon. Friend the Home Secretary said in his notable contribution to the debate, people are behind us in this step to change the law and to ma e it more humane and to remove some of the anomalies which inhibit both doctors and patients in the search for a solution to this problem. But the State and the law are concerned with all people and are not obliged to observe, although they should respect, the religious scruples of the minority. It is not for me to attempt to join in any of the religious arguments put forward today. I am not qualified to do so. Nor shall I bandy words with the hon. Member for Chelmsford about the assessed numbers of illegal abortions.
