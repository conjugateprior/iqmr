When I heard that the Bill was to be introduced, I attended a one-day conference organised by the Family Planning Association. One general practitioner ended his speech with this cry from the heart: I do not think that women are selfish. In general, they are very law-abiding. They rarely seek an abortion for its own sake, but for the sake of the family and the unborn child. I suggest that we know very little about what drives a woman to try to terminate her pregnancy. Until our antique and confusing abortion laws are changed, many women will continue to seek these illegal abortions.
