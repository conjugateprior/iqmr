I have had a great many letters from doctors since it was stated in the Press that I supported the Amendment, and I should like to quote briefly from one of them. It is from Professor McLaren, Head of the Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology at Birmingham University. The argument that abortion should be possible where there is a reasonable chance of the child being born deformed is one which, on the face of it, we could all support. Yet that is not easy, because who is to say that a child with a club foot or a spastic child is not fit to live? Who is to say that he cannot enjoy life? I have seen plenty of spastics who appear to be thoroughly enjoying life. There is something utterly repugnant to me here, because it so reminds me of Hitler's conception of a race of perfect physical specimens. Is it right that only the physically perfect should be allowed to survive? We should be careful how we answer that one.
