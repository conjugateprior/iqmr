When we go beyond the question of danger to life and physical and mental health, I find myself not wholly in agreement with the provisions in the Bill, but I go a little less far than some who have objected and a little further than others. For example, I accept Clause 1(1, ) unreservedly. This is one that I know has given some considerable difficulty and doubt to other hon. Members. I agree that this is something extraordinarily difficult to define, and it will be extraordinarily difficult to prove. Nevertheless, I believe that paragraph is right and that, subject to clarification and definition, this should form part of the Bill.
