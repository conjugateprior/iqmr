I want to make it clear from the outset that, though I speak from the Front Bench, I am not, on behalf of the Opposition, advancing any view one way or the other about the Bill. This is not only a Private Member's Bill, but it is one of those Private Members' Bills on which we all agree that there should be no party view. It should not be assumed that Private Members' Bills should not arouse deep and passionate party contentions. However, there are classes of Private Members' Bills which deal with moral and ethical questions affecting the individual citizen in relation to which it is right and proper that hon. Members should not adopt a party attitude.
