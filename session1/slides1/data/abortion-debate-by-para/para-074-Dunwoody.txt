Perhaps I might just make one point. Would not my hon. and learned Friend agree that the situation at the moment is that the vast majority of legal abortions which occur, and also certain obstetric manoeuvres, which are, fortunately, not as frequently used now as in days gone by, involve the destruction of potentially healthy babies? This is the situation which is present at this moment.
