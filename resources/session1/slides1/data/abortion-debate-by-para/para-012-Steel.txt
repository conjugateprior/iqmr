In England and Wales the law has developed over a series of cases, the most noted of which was the Bourne case, in 1938, when a distinguished gynaecologist was tried, following the termination of a pregnancy that he carried out on a girl who, at the age of 14, had been raped by a soldier. Unfortunately, the case was not judged on the issue whether or not it was right, because of the circumstances of conception, for this operation to have been carried out ; the judgment was based on the effects which the continuation of the pregnancy would have on the patient. The judge, in directing the jury, stated that where a medical practitioner was convinced that the effects of a pregnancy on his patient would be to make the woman a physical or mental wreck, he was justified in carrying out the operation. There has been a series of cases since then which have developed this aspect of the law.
