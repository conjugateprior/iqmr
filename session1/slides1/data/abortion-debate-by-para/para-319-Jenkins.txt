There are certainly logical attractions in this course which would go much further than putting the back-street abortionist out of business, but I recognise as I think we all must that many even among those who support major social reform in this field feel that this would be going too far and that we must try to find a defensible half-way house. The Bill, I think, attempts a compromise which in spite of some practical and legal difficulties, might I hope be broadly acceptable to a majority of the House.
