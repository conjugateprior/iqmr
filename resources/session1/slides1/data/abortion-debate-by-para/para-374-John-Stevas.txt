The Amendment pays tribute to the humanitarian motives of the sponsors of the Bill. That is not a piece of cant, as the hon. Member for Pontypool suggested. It is a genuine appreciation of the depth of conviction of those who support the Bill. But we are not concerned so much with the motives of hon. Members. We are concerned with the effects of the legislation which they promote. Considering the effects of the Bill, there is only one word and I choose it very carefully which I would use to characterise some of these proposals, and that is" barbarous" because they attack a principle on which the whole security of society rests, namely, the principle of the sanctity of life.
