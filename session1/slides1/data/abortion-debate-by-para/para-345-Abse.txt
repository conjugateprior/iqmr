Statistics have been quoted by the Royal College which conform with my opinion that a high percentage of women may suffer all their lives as a consequence of the guilt which burdens them when they find they have decided to kill their own child. Depression and serious psychiatric disorders can follow. I hope that nobody will allow it to go out from the House that in adopting a Measure of this kind we are taking the question of abortion lightly.
