The hon. Member for Roxburgh, Selkirk and Peebles quoted figures from 200,000 at one end to 40,000 at the other. That is an immense variation. Lord Silkin quoted a figure of 100,000 illegal abortions a year, which I was very distressed to hear the Home Secretary use in his speech. As far as I know, that is a statistic founded on no evidence whatever ; it is a guess. I was sorry to see the Home Secretary depart from his neutrality on that point. Other evidence put forward by Dr. Goodhart in a learned medical journal puts it at 10,000. My point here is that these statistics are so unreliable that they cannot be used as a basis for a rational judgment.
