We should not consider the Bill without awareness of some streams of current thinking. It may well be that science and its little pill will enable so-called civilised countries to treat sex more and more as a sport and less and less as a sacrament in love, a divine instrument of procreation. It may well be, in fairness, that the Bill stops far short of that, but it is that consideration that gives me pause now. That is why I think we should do what is absolutely necessary to give more guidance to doctors to clarify matters, but not more than is necessary. The right answer, if there is one, is almost certainly the hardest answer, and probably, to the majority of people, the unacceptable answer.
