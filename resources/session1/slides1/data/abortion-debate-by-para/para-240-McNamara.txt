The second point is the argument as to the inhumanity of the present law. I wish to deal briefly with the problem of the back-street abortionist. I will deal later with paragraphs and of Clause 1(1). But if the Bill covers only the grounds which are in Clause 1 there are still many cases which will make necessary recourse to the back-street abortionist. If, on the other hand, this is not so, then the Bill, if passed, which I hope it will not be, will not be rigorously enforced and we are merely legislating to make a mockery of ourselves and finding a pretext of one form or another to allow mothers to be aborted apparently legally with adequate medical safeguards.
