THE BEST FUTURE FOR BRITAIN

FOREWORD

MR JOHN MAJOR, PRIME MINISTER AND LEADER OF THE CONSERVATIVE 
PARTY, SAID IN HIS FOREWORD THAT AT THE END OF THIS PARLIAMENT A 
NEW MILLENNIUM WOULD BE IN VIEW. "WE MUST RAISE OUR SIGHTS 
HIGH. THIS MANIFESTO IS ABOUT MAKING OUR COUNTRY RESPECTED AND 
SECURE, AND HELPING YOU ACHIEVE A BETTER, SAFER AND MORE 
PROSPEROUS FUTURE. FOR I BELIEVE-STRONGLY-THAT YOU, AND NOT 
THE GOVERNMENT, SHOULD BE IN CHARGE OF YOUR LIFE. THAT'S WHAT 
CONSERVATISM STANDS FOR. THAT PRINCIPLE UNDERLIES ALL THE 
POLICIES IN THIS MANIFESTO." 
    HE DECLARED: "ONLY CONSERVATIVES CAN TRULY CLAIM TO BE THE 
PARTY OF OPPORTUNITY; CHOICE; OWNERSHIP AND RESPONSIBILITY. 
SOCIALISTS LIKE TO KEEP PEOPLE UNDER THE GOVERNMENT'S THUMB. 
CONSERVATIVES WANT TO GIVE THEM INDEPENDENCE. BUT WE ALSO 
WANT TO PUT GOVERNMENT AT YOUR SERVICE, GIVING YOU WHAT YOU'VE 
PAID FOR-GOOD PUBLIC SERVICES, RESPONSIBLE TO YOU. YOU KNOW I 
BELIEVE IN CHOICE AND IN THIS ELECTION, AS ALWAYS, THERE IS 
ANOTHER CHOICE. YOU CAN VOTE FOR OUR OPPONENTS, AND WATCH 
THEM TAKE BRITAIN BACK TO THE1970S. BACK TO SOCIALISM. BACK TO 
STRIKES. BACK TO STRIFE. BACK TO THE WORLD'S PITY, OR WORSE STILL, 
CONTEMPT. I DON'T BELIEVE BRITAIN WANTS THAT. I KNOW THE WORLD 
DOESN'T WANT THAT FOR BRITAIN. I HOPE YOU WILL CHOOSE A DIFFERENT 
PATH-TO GO FORWARD, NOT BACK; TO GO FOR THE BEST, KNOWING THAT 
BRITAIN CAN BE THE BEST AND DO IT BEST. MY BELIEF IS CLEAR. ONLY 
THE BEST IS GOOD ENOUGH FOR BRITAIN." 

TAKING RESPONSIBILITY FOR BRITAIN

THE WORLD HAS BEEN TRANSFORMED IN RECENT YEARS. COMMUNISM 
HAS COLLAPSED IN EASTERN EUROPE, AND THE SOVIET UNION HAS 
FALLEN APART. EVERYWHERE SOCIALISM IS IN RETREAT AND DEMOCRACY. 
HUMAN RIGHTS AND MARKET ECONOMICS ARE ADVANCING. THE 
AUTHORITY OF THE UN HAS BEEN BOLSTERED AND IRAQI AGGRESSION 
SEEN OFF. TALKS ARE UNDER WAY IN THE MIDDLE EAST AND SOUTH 
AFRICA. IT IS A TIME OF GREAT OPPORTUNITY, BUT ALSO OF NEW 
DANGERS. BRITAIN NEEDS FIRM LEADERSHIP AT THIS TIME. WE MUST BE 
REPRESENTED BY A TEAM OF QUALITY AND EXPERIENCE. A TEAM WHICH 
CAN HELP SHAPE THE WORLD FOR THE NEXT CENTURY. A CONSERVATIVE 
TEAM.  
   UNDER THE CONSERVATIVES, BRITAIN HAS REGAINED HER RIGHTFUL 
INFLUENCE IN THE WORLD. WE HAVE STOOD UP FOR THE VALUES OUR 
COUNTRY HAS ALWAYS REPRESENTED. WE HAVE DEFENDED BRITAIN'S 
INTERESTS WITH VIGOUR AND WITH SUCCESS. THE RESPECT WITH WHICH 
BRITAIN IS REGARDED IN THE WORLD HAS RARELY BEEN HIGHER. WE PLAY 
A CENTRAL PART IN WORLD AFFAIRS AS A MEMBER OF THE EUROPEAN 
COMMUNITY, NATO, THE COMMONWEALTH AND THE GROUP OF 7 
LEADING INDUSTRIAL COUNTRIES, AND AS A PERMANENT MEMBER OF THE 
UN SECURITY COUNCIL. NO OTHER COUNTRY HOLDS ALL THESE 
POSITIONS.  
   WE ARE TAKING A LEADING ROLE IN RECASTING ALL THE MAIN 
INTERNATIONAL INSTITUTIONS TO WHICH WE BELONG: THE UNITED 
NATIONS, THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITY, NATO, AND THE 
COMMONWEALTH. THE PRIME MINISTER CONVENED THE FIRST EVER 
MEETING OF THE UN SECURITY COUNCIL AT HEADS OF GOVERNMENT 
LEVEL. BETWEEN NOW AND THE END OF 1992 THERE WILL BE SEVEN 
SUMMITS WHERE ISSUES OF CRITICAL IMPORTANCE TO OUR FUTURE WILL 
BE DETERMINED: TWO EC COUNCILS, AT LISBON AND EDINBURGH, THE 
G7 SUMMIT, THE CSCE SUMMIT. EC SUMMITS WITH THE US AND 
JAPAN, AND THE EARTH SUMMIT AT RIO DE JANEIRO. BRITAIN WILL BE 
AT THE CENTRE OF THESE NEGOTIATIONS.
 
THE NEED FOR LEADERSHIP

THE END OF THE COLD WAR HAS ENABLED THE UN TO ACT WITH NEW 
UNITY AND AUTHORITY. UNDER THE AUTHORITY OF THE UN, BRITISH 
FORCES PLAYED A LEADING AND COURAGEOUS PART IN THE GULF WAR 
AND THE LIBERATION OF KUWAIT. AT THE PRIME MINISTER'S 
INSTIGATION, THE UN ALSO BACKED THE OPERATION TO PROTECT THE 
KURDS. BRITAIN HAS LED THE WORLD IN HELPING THE REFORMS IN THE 
FORMER SOVIET UNION. THE PRIME MINISTER GAVE FULL AND 
IMMEDIATE SUPPORT TO PRESIDENT YELTSIN IN THE AUGUST COUP 
ATTEMPT AND WAS THE FIRST WESTERN LEADER TO VISIT MOSCOW AFTER 
THE COUP FAILED. BRITAIN HAS LED THE WAY IN BUILDING UP RELATIONS 
WITH THE REPUBLICS OF THE NEW COMMONWEALTH OF INDEPENDENT 
STATES. WE HAVE PROVIDED VALUABLE ECONOMIC AND HUMANITARIAN 
AID TO EASE THE TRANSITION TO A MARKET ECONOMY. 
 WE WILL SUPPORT AN ENHANCED ROLE FOR THE UN IN PEACE-
KEEPING AND COMBATING STATE-SPONSORED TERRORISM. 
 WE ARE DETERMINED THAT IRAQ SHOULD COMPLY WITH THE TERMS OF 
THE GULF WAR CEASE-FIRE AGREEMENT, AND IN PARTICULAR THAT IT 
SHOULD CO-OPERATE WITH THE UN IN DISMANTLING ITS WEAPONS OF 
MASS DESTRUCTION. 
 WE SUPPORT EARLY RUSSIAN MEMBERSHIP OF THE IMF AND WORLD 
BANK, AS WELL AS A STABILISATION FUND FOR THE ROUBLE. 
 WE ARE CO-OPERATING WITH OUR PARTNERS TO PROVIDE URGENT HELP 
TO THE FORMER SOVIET UNION AND EASTERN EUROPE TO UPGRADE THE 
SAFETY OF THEIR NUCLEAR POWER STATIONS.
 WE STRONGLY SUPPORT THE PEACE PROCESS IN THE MIDDLE EAST. 
THE OUTCOME OF THE TALKS MUST SAFEGUARD THE SECURITY OF ISRAEL 
AND ACHIEVE SELF-DETERMINATION FOR THE PEOPLE OF THE OCCUPIED 
TERRITORIES. 
 WE WILL SAFEGUARD THE PROSPERITY OF HONG KONG, NURTURE 
DEMOCRATIC INSTITUTIONS AND WORK WITH THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT 
WITHIN THE TERMS OF THE JOINT DECLARATION. 
 WE SEEK A SOLUTION TO THE DISPUTE WHICH HAS DIVIDED CYPRUS 
SINCE 1974. A SETTLEMENT MUST RECOGNISE THAT CYPRUS IS 
INDIVISIBLE AND THAT THE RIGHTS OF BOTH COMMUNITIES MUST BE 
ASSURED. WE WILL SUPPORT THE UN'S EFFORTS TO SECURE A FAIR AND 
LASTING SOLUTION. 
 THE PROBLEMS OF KASHMIR CANNOT BE RESOLVED BY VIOLENCE. WE 
URGE BOTH INDIA AND PAKISTAN TO ADDRESS AND RESOLVE THE ISSUE, 
AND WE STAND READY TO HELP.
 
OUR INFLUENCE FOR GOOD

ALL OVER THE WORLD COUNTRIES ARE TURNING TO DEMOCRACY AND FREE 
MARKETS. LAST OCTOBER IN HARARE, THE COMMONWEALTH TOOK ON A 
NEW ROLE AS A PROMOTER OF DEMOCRACY, THE RULE OF LAW, AND 
RESPECT FOR INDIVIDUAL FREEDOMS. ALREADY THE COMMONWEALTH IS 
MONITORING ELECTIONS TO ENSURE THAT THEY ARE FREE AND FAIR. 
BRITAIN IS TAKING THE LEAD IN ENCOURAGING THESE TRENDS. 
    WE GIVE SUBSTANTIAL AID TO THE RELIEF OF POVERTY AND TO HELP 
THE STRUGGLING ECONOMIES OF THE DEVELOPING WORLD. OUR AID 
PROGRAMME NEXT YEAR (EXCLUDING AID TO EASTERN EUROPE AND THE 
CIS) WILL REACH £1,800 MILLION. BRITAIN ALSO MAKES MORE DIRECT 
PRIVATE INVESTMENT IN THE DEVELOPING WORLD THAN ANY OTHER EC 
COUNTRY-SOME £2,400 MILLION IN 1989. WE ARE URGING THE 
INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY TO TAKE DECISIVE ACTION ON DEBT RELIEF, 
THE LIBERALISATION OF WORLD TRADE AND SUPPORT FOR GOOD 
GOVERNMENT.  
   WE CONTINUE TO ACCEPT THE LONG-TERM UN TARGET FOR AID OF 0.7 
PER CENT OF GNP, ALTHOUGH WE CANNOT SET A TIMETABLE FOR ITS 
ACHIEVEMENT. THE QUALITY OF BRITAIN'S OVERSEAS AID PROGRAMME 
IS SECOND TO NONE. IT IS WELL TARGETED AND HIGHLY EFFECTIVE. 
EIGHTY PER CENT OF OUR BILATERAL AID GOES TO THE POOREST 
COUNTRIES. NEW AID TO THE POOREST IS GIVEN AS GRANTS, NOT LOANS. 
    WE ARE SUPPORTING PROJECTS DESIGNED TO BUILD EFFICIENT 
INSTITUTIONS AND ACCOUNTABLE GOVERNMENT. WE ARE HELPING TO 
IMPROVE PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION AND THE LEGAL SYSTEM IN A NUMBER 
OF COUNTRIES. THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE IS ONE OF OUR NATION'S 
GREATEST ASSETS-CULTURALLY, POLITICALLY AND COMMERCIALLY. THE 
BBC WORLD SERVICE HAS UNRIVALLED STANDING AROUND THE GLOBE. 
THE BRITISH COUNCIL ACTS AS A CULTURAL AMBASSADOR FOR BRITAIN 
AND FOR THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE. 
 WE WILL USE OVERSEAS AID TO PROMOTE GOOD GOVERNMENT, 
SENSIBLE ECONOMIC POLICIES, THE ROOTING OUT OF CORRUPTION, 
AND-CRUCIALLY-RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS AND THE RULE OF LAW. 
 WE WILL PRESS CREDITOR COUNTRIES TO ACCEPT THE PRIME MINISTER'S 
PROPOSAL-THE "TRINIDAD TERMS" -FOR A TWO-THIRDS REDUCTION IN 
THE OFFICIAL DEBT OF THE POOREST COUNTRIES.
 WE WILL PROMOTE THE DEVELOPMENT OF MULTI-PARTY SYSTEMS 
THROUGH THE NEW WESTMINSTER FOUNDATION FOR DEMOCRACY. 
 WE WILL PROMOTE THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE BY STRENGTHENING BOTH 
THE BRITISH COUNCIL AND THE BBC WORLD SERVICE. WE WILL 
ENCOURAGE BOTH TO BECOME MORE ENTREPRENEURIAL IN ORDER TO 
FINANCE THEIR ACTIVITIES IN DEVELOPING MARKETS. 
THE RISKS WE FACE NOW
THE COLLAPSE OF THE OLD SOVIET UNION HAS DRAMATICALLY 
VINDICATED CONSERVATIVE DEFENCE POLICY. WE HAVE ALWAYS PUT 
THE SECURITY OF OUR COUNTRY FIRST. WE HAVE KEPT THE PEACE BY 
STAYING STRONG. TODAY THE THREAT OF A MASSIVE SURPRISE ATTACK 
FROM EASTERN EUROPE HAS GONE. BUT WE STILL FACE GRAVE RISKS TO 
OUR SECURITY. WE CANNOT DROP OUR GUARD. UNDER THE 
CONSERVATIVES, BRITAIN WILL NEVER DO SO.  
   WITHIN THE FORMER SOVIET UNION THERE REMAINS A HUGE MILITARY 
FORCE. DEMOCRACY AND THE RULE OF LAW ARE YET TO BE FIRMLY 
ESTABLISHED. CONTROL OVER THESE ARMED FORCES AND THE MASSIVE 
NUCLEAR CAPABILITY IS UNCERTAIN. THE EVENTS IN YUGOSLAVIA SHOW 
WHAT CAN HAPPEN WHEN COMMUNISM COLLAPSES IN DISORDER.  
   INCREASINGLY, THREATS COME FROM OUTSIDE EUROPE-AS WE SAW 
SO CLEARLY IN THE GULF. M ANY MORE COUNTRIES ARE ACQUIRING LARGE 
STOCKS OF MODERN ARMS. SOME ARE TRYING TO OBTAIN NUCLEAR, 
BIOLOGICAL AND CHEMICAL WEAPONS. BRITAIN MUST BE ABLE TO 
RESPOND TO ANY UNEXPECTED DANGER.  
   THE CONSERVATIVES ARE THE ONLY PARTY WHO RECOGNISE BOTH THE 
OPPORTUNITIES AND THE THREATS OF THE NEW WORLD. FOR OVER FORTY 
YEARS, OUR SECURITY HAS BEEN BASED FIRMLY ON NATO, THE MOST 
SUCCESSFUL DEFENSIVE ALLIANCE EVER. WE WILL WORK WITH OUR ALLIES 
TO ENSURE THAT NATO REMAINS THE CORNERSTONE OF OUR DEFENCE. 
BRITAIN WILL COMMAND A NEW NATO RAPID REACTION CORPS READY 
TO DEPLOY QUICKLY TO COUNTER ANY SUDDEN THREAT. AS EUROPEANS 
WE MUST ACCEPT A GREATER ROLE IN SAFEGUARDING THE PEACE ON OUR 
CONTINENT.   
  WE WILL PROMOTE ARMS CONTROL AND REDUCTION INITIATIVES. ON 
BRITAIN'S INITIATIVE, THE UN IS ESTABLISHING A REGISTER OF ARMS 
TRANSFERS IN ORDER TO MONITOR ANY DANGEROUS ARSENALS OF 
WEAPONS.  
   BRITAIN HAS ALWAYS BEEN STRONGLY OPPOSED TO NUCLEAR 
PROLIFERATION. WE WILL BACK AN ENHANCED ROLE FOR THE 
INTERNATIONAL ATOMIC ENERGY AGENCY IN INSPECTING NUCLEAR SITES 
AND FOR THE UN SECURITY COUNCIL IN ACTING AGAINST THOSE NATIONS 
WHICH BREAK THEIR NON-PROLIFERATION OBLIGATIONS. 
 WE WILL WORK TO STRENGTHEN THE WESTERN EUROPEAN UNION AS 
THE EUROPEAN PILLAR OF NATO. WE WILL PRESS FOR A EUROPEAN 
REACTION FORCE. 
 WE WILL INTENSIFY THE CO-ORDINATION OF SECURITY POLICIES WITHIN 
THE TWELVE. 
 WE WILL WORK THROUGH THE CSCE TO SAFEGUARD THE SECURITY OF 
EUROPE. 
 WE WILL SUPPORT A COMPREHENSIVE AND VERIFIABLE BAN ON 
CHEMICAL WEAPONS, AND FURTHER CONTROLS ON THE EXPORT OF ITEMS 
WHICH COULD BE USED IN MAKING BIOLOGICAL WEAPONS. 
 WE WILL HELP RUSSIA IN HER EFFORTS TO DISMANTLE NUCLEAR 
WEAPONS.
 
OUR ARMED FORCE

ONLY THE CONSERVATIVES CAN BE TRUSTED TO MAINTAIN THE QUALITY 
AND CAPABILITY OF OUR ARMED FORCES. WE ARE PROUD OF THE SKILL, 
COURAGE AND PROFESSIONALISM WHICH THEY DISPLAYED IN THE GULF 
AND WHICH THEY SHOW DAILY IN NORTHERN IRELAND. WE ARE THE 
ONLY PARTY UNAMBIGUOUSLY COMMITTED TO THE PRESERVATION AND 
MODERNISATION OF OUR INDEPENDENT NUCLEAR DETERRENT.  
   OUR DEFENCE WOULD BE UNSAFE IN THE HANDS OF THE OPPOSITION 
PARTIES. LABOUR HAVE OPPOSED OUR DEFENCE POLICIES AT EVERY 
TURN. THEY HAVE TWISTED AND TURNED IN THEIR ATTITUDE TO OUR 
NUCLEAR DETERRENT. THEY WOULD DEVASTATE OUR CONVENTIONAL 
FORCES BY CUTS
 OF AT LEAST 27 PER CENT, WHICH WOULD LEAD TO HUGE JOB LOSSES IN 
THE DEFENCE INDUSTRIES.     THE LIBERAL DEMOCRATS WOULD CAUSE 
EVEN MORE DAMAGE TO BRITAIN'S DEFENCES. THEIR AIM IS TO CUT OUR 
DEFENCE SPENDING BY HALF BY THE END OF THE DECADE. 
    WE INSIST THAT OUR FORCES HAVE THE MODERN, EFFECTIVE 
EQUIPMENT THAT THEY NEED. THE GULF WAR SHOWED THAT THE 
SERVICES MUST HAVE THE LATEST TECHNOLOGY TO GIVE THEM 
MAXIMUM FLEXIBILITY AND MOBILITY. THAT IS WHY WE HAVE 
ORDERED THE NEW CHALLENGER II TANK FOR THE ARMY, THE MERLIN 
HELICOPTER FOR THE NAVY, THE ASRAAM AIR DEFENCE MISSILE FOR THE 
RAF AND A WIDE RANGE OF OTHER NEW EQUIPMENT FOR OUR FORCES.  
   OUR REAPPRAISAL OF BRITAIN'S DEFENCE NEEDS WILL RESULT IN A 
MAJOR RESTRUCTURING OF OUR ARMED FORCES TO TAKE ACCOUNT OF THE 
CHANGING WORLD SITUATION. IN FUTURE OUR FORCES WILL BE SMALLER, 
BUT BETTER EQUIPPED. OUR SERVICES DESERVE THE EXCELLENT PAY AND 
CONDITIONS WHICH WE HAVE SECURED FOR THEM AND WILL MAINTAIN. 
 WE WILL COMPLETE THE DEPLOYMENT OF THE NEXT GENERATION OF 
BRITAIN'S MINIMUM NUCLEAR DETERRENT. WE WILL ORDER AND 
COMPLETE THE FOURTH TRIDENT SUBMARINE. 
 WE WILL ENSURE THE FORCES HAVE THE BEST AND MOST MODERN 
EQUIPMENT. 
 WE WILL IMPROVE THE QUALITY AND MANAGEMENT OF SERVICE 
HOUSING AND HELP THOSE IN THE FORCES SAVE TOWARDS BUYING A 
HOME OF THEIR OWN. 
 THE RESERVES WILL PLAY AN EVEN MORE IMPORTANT ROLE AND WE 
WILL INTRODUCE LEGISLATION TO ALLOW THEIR MORE FLEXIBLE USE.
 
THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITY

THE CONSERVATIVES HAVE BEEN THE PARTY OF BRITAIN IN EUROPE FOR 
30 YEARS. WE HAVE ARGUED WHEN ARGUMENT WAS NECESSARY; BUT 
WE HAVE NOT WAVERED NOR CHANGED OUR VIEWS. WE HAVE ENSURED 
THAT BRITAIN IS AT THE HEART OF EUROPE; A STRONG AND RESPECTED 
PARTNER.  
   WE HAVE PLAYED A DECISIVE PART IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE 
COMMUNITY OVER THE PAST DECADE. IT WAS A BRITISH INITIATIVE 
WHICH LAUNCHED THE SINGLE MARKET PROGRAMME AND OUR 
INSISTENCE WHICH REFORMED THE COMMUNITY'S FINANCES. BRITAIN 
HAS PROMOTED CO-OPERATION ON FOREIGN POLICY AND IN COMBATING 
TERRORISM. BRITAIN HAS ALSO PERSUADED OUR PARTNERS TO WELCOME 
NEW COUNTRIES WHO APPLY FOR COMMUNITY MEMBERSHIP.  
   THE MAASTRICHT TREATY WAS A SUCCESS BOTH FOR BRITAIN AND FOR 
THE REST OF EUROPE. BRITISH PROPOSALS HELPED TO SHAPE THE KEY 
PROVISIONS OF THE TREATY, INCLUDING THOSE STRENGTHENING THE 
ENFORCEMENT OF COMMUNITY LAW, DEFENCE, SUBSIDIARITY AND LAW 
AND ORDER. BUT BRITAIN REFUSED TO ACCEPT THE DAMAGING SOCIAL 
CHAPTER PROPOSED BY OTHER EUROPEANS, AND IT WAS EXCLUDED FROM 
THE MAASTRICHT TREATY.  
   ALL MEMBER STATES MUST LIVE UP TO THEIR OBLIGATIONS UNDER 
COMMUNITY LAW. AT MAASTRICHT, WE SECURED AGREEMENT THAT THE 
EUROPEAN COURT WILL BE ABLE TO FINE ANY MEMBER STATE WHICH 
FAILS TO DO 
SO .
 WE WILL WORK CLOSELY WITH OUR PARTNERS IN FOREIGN POLICY AND 
IN THE WAR ON INTERNATIONAL CRIME. 
 WE WILL CONTINUE TO RESIST CHANGES TO THE TREATY OF ROME THAT 
WOULD DAMAGE BRITISH BUSINESS. 
 WE WILL RESIST COMMISSION INITIATIVES WHICH RUN COUNTER TO THE 
PRINCIPLE THAT ISSUES SHOULD BE DEALT WITH ON A NATIONAL BASIS 
WHEREVER POSSIBLE. 
 BRITAIN IS A GREAT TRADING NATION. WE PROSPER THROUGH THE 
MAINTENANCE OF AN OPEN TRADING SYSTEM. WE WILL WORK FOR A 
SUCCESSFUL OUTCOME TO THE GATT NEGOTIATIONS. 
 WE WILL REDOUBLE OUR EFFORTS TO REFORM THE COMMON 
AGRICULTURAL POLICY AND WILL STOUTLY DEFEND THE INTERESTS OF 
BRITISH FARMERS AND CONSUMERS. 
 WE WILL INSIST ON MORE EFFECTIVE CONTROL OVER COMMUNITY 
SPENDING AND WILL RESIST PRESSURE TO EXTEND COMMUNITY 
COMPETENCE TO NEW AREAS. 
 WE WILL WORK TO STRENGTHEN THE EXTERNAL FRONTIERS OF THE 
COMMUNITY WHILST MAINTAINING THE CHECKS NEEDED AT OUR OWN 
BORDERS AGAINST ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION, DRUGS, TERRORISM AND 
DISEASE.
 
THE BRITISH PRESIDENCY

IN THE SECOND HALF OF 1992 BRITAIN WILL TAKE THE CHAIR OF THE 
COUNCIL OF MINISTERS. THE BRITISH PRESIDENCY COMES AT A TURNING 
POINT IN THE COMMUNITY'S HISTORY. IT GIVES US THE
OPPORTUNITY TO SHAPE THE DIRECTION OF THE COMMUNITY AND TO 
ESTABLISH ITS PRIORITIES. WE SHALL USE IT TO PROMOTE OUR VISION OF 
AN OUTWARD LOOKING COMMUNITY BASED ON FREE ENTERPRISE.  
   OUR PRESIDENCY WILL REACH ITS CLIMAX AT THE EDINBURGH 
MEETING OF THE EUROPEAN COUNCIL, WHICH WE WILL HOLD IN THE 
HISTORIC PALACE OF HOLYROOD HOUSE. WHILE THE ATTENTION OF 
EUROPE IS FOCUSED ON EDINBURGH, THE STRENGTH OF OUR UNION WILL 
BE VISIBLE TO ALL.   
  OUR PRIORITIES WILL BE:
 TO START NEGOTIATIONS WITH THOSE EFTA COUNTRIES WHO WANT TO 
JOIN THE COMMUNITY SO THAT THEY CAN JOIN BY 1995. TO BUILD 
ON THE EC'S ASSOCIATION AGREEMENTS WITH CZECHOSLOVAKIA, 
HUNGARY AND POLAND SO THAT WE CAN WELCOME THEM TO FULL 
MEMBERSHIP BY THE YEAR 2000.
 TO CONCLUDE EC TRADE AND CO-OPERATION AGREEMENTS WITH THE 
MAIN REPUBLICS OF THE FORMER SOVIET UNION. TO COMPLETE THE 
SINGLE MARKET AND EXTEND IT TO THE SEVEN COUNTRIES OF EFTA. 
OVER HALF OUR TRADE IS WITH THE REST OF THE COMMUNITY. THE 
SINGLE MARKET WILL CREATE AN OPEN MARKET OF 350 MILLION 
CUSTOMERS FOR BRITISH GOODS AND SERVICES. TO COMPLETE THE 
SINGLE MARKET WE SHALL AIM TO: -OPEN UP THE MARKET FOR LIFE 
INSURANCE TO FREE COMPETITION;
-LIBERALISE AIR TRAVEL TO BRING DOWN AIR FARES IN EUROPE CLOSER 
TO THOSE IN AMERICA;
-FREE UP THE SHIPPING AND ROAD TRANSPORT MARKETS SO THAT 
BRITISH OPERATORS CAN CARRY FREELY WITHIN THE EC; -INCREASE 
COMPETITION IN THE EUROPEAN ENERGY SECTOR.
 WE WILL PROVIDE GUIDANCE AND HELP TO ANY BRITISH COMPANY 
ENCOUNTERING A TRADE BARRIER ILLEGAL UNDER EUROPEAN LAW.
 WE WILL PRESS FOR PROGRESS ON THE ENVIRONMENT, INCLUDING THE 
FIFTH ENVIRONMENT ACTION PROGRAMME.
 WE WILL CHAIR THE NEGOTIATIONS ON THE FUTURE SPENDING 
PRIORITIES OF THE COMMUNITY TO ENSURE VALUE FOR MONEY. WE WILL 
SAFEGUARD THE ABATEMENT NEGOTIATED BY MRS THATCHER WHICH HAS 
SO FAR BROUGHT SOME £12,000 MILLION IN BUDGET REBATES TO 
BRITAIN.
 
WEALTH AND OWNERSHIP

THE 1990S PRESENT A GREAT ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITY FOR BRITAIN. 
WE HAVE GOT THE SCOURGE OF INFLATION UNDER CONTROL. WE HAVE 
CUT DIRECT TAX RATES. AND A STABLE CURRENCY GIVES INDUSTRY A 
CHANCE TO REALISE THE POTENTIAL RELEASED BY THE REFORMS OF THE 
1980S. 
    WE HAVE EXTENDED OWNERSHIP MORE WIDELY-OF HOMES, 
SAVINGS AND SHARES-WITH MILLIONS MORE SHARING DIRECTLY IN 
BRITAIN'S SUCCESS. WE WILL PROMOTE ENTERPRISE THROUGH LOW 
TAXES, SOUND MONEY AND A STABLE CURRENCY.  
   WHEN THE EXCHANGE-RATE MECHANISM WAS BEING CREATED, 
DURING THE FINAL DAYS OF THE LAST LABOUR GOVERNMENT, THE THEN 
PRIME MINISTER DECIDED BRITAIN COULD NOT TAKE PART. IT WAS EASY 
TO SEE WHY. THE ECONOMY WAS TOO WEAK. INFLATION WAS TOO HIGH. 
IN 1974-9, THE INFLATION RATE AVERAGED OVER 15 PER CENT. IT 
PEAKED AT 27 PER CENT. PUBLIC BORROWING ROSE TO NEARLY 10 PER 
CENT OF NATIONAL INCOME-EQUIVALENT TO £55,000 MILLION TODAY. 
PENAL TAXES BLUNTED ENTERPRISE. BRITAIN WAS A BYWORD FOR 
STRIKES.  
   THE CONSERVATIVES HAVE CHANGED ALL THAT. SINCE 1979, OUR 
INFLATION RATE HAS AVERAGED 7.5 PER CENT. NOW IT IS ONLY JUST OVER 
4 PER CENT-BELOW THE AVERAGE FOR THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITY. IN 
THE 1960S AND 1970S, BRITAIN HAD THE SLOWEST GROWTH RATE IN THE 
EUROPEAN COMMUNITY. BUT IN THE 1980S, WE GREW FASTER THAN 
EITHER FRANCE OR GERMANY. INDUSTRIAL DISPUTES BECAME RARE 
EVENTS. AND IN 1990 A CONSERVATIVE GOVERNMENT JOINED THE 
ERM.  
   PENAL TAXES HAVE BEEN ABOLISHED. A MAN ON AVERAGE EARNINGS, 
WITH A WIFE AND TWO CHILDREN, HAS AN INCOME TODAY WHICH AFTER 
TAX AND INFLATION IS 39 PER CENT HIGHER THAN IT WAS IN LABOUR'S 
LAST YEAR. THAT GREAT ADVANCE IN THE STANDARD OF LIVING IS AT RISK 
IN THIS ELECTION.  
   SINCE THE WAR, LIVING STANDARDS HAVE ALWAYS RISEN FASTER UNDER 
CONSERVATIVE GOVERNMENTS THAN UNDER LABOUR. NOW WE ARE 
PLEDGED TO CUT TAX RATES AGAIN-AND HAVE MADE A START ON THE 
ROAD TO 20P INCOME TAX.   
  CORPORATE TAX RATES HAVE BEEN CUT, TOO. OUR BUSINESS 
INVESTMENT HAS INCREASED MORE RAPIDLY THAN IN ANY OTHER MAJOR 
ECONOMY EXCEPT JAPAN. BRITAIN ATTRACTS BY FAR THE BIGGEST SHARE 
OF JAPANESE AND AMERICAN INVESTMENT IN EUROPE. THAT, TOO, IS 
AT RISK IN THIS ELECTION. 

BRITAIN'S OPPORTUNITY

    WE ARE NOW MEMBERS OF: -THE BIGGEST FREE MARKET IN THE 
WORLD. BRITISH INDUSTRY IS AGAIN RESPECTED IN EUROPE. -A ZONE 
OF LOW INFLATION, IN WHICH WE CAN COMPETE WITH THE BEST.     
BRITAIN MUST NOT THROW THIS OPPORTUNITY AWAY BY ELECTING A 
LABOUR GOVERNMENT. THE WORLD RECESSION HAS BEEN TOUGH FOR ALL 
OF US, AT HOME AND ABROAD. UNEMPLOYMENT HAS RISEN. BUT IN 
BRITAIN WE HAVE LAID THE FOUNDATIONS FOR RECOVERY. WHAT IS 
NEEDED TO TRIGGER CONFIDENCE AND GROWTH IS A CONSERVATIVE 
VICTORY WITH A DECISIVE MAJORITY. 
WHAT WOULD POSTPONE RECOVERY, AND TURN THIS PROMISE OF 
GROWTH INTO THE CERTAINTY OF HARD TIMES, IS THE ELECTION OF OUR 
OPPONENTS WHOSE POLICIES WOULD MEAN HIGHER TAXES, HIGHER 
INFLATION, HIGHER INTEREST RATES, MORE BUREAUCRATIC REGULATION AND 
MORE STRIKES.
     IN THE 1990S, THE GOVERNMENT'S TASK WILL BE TO PROVIDE AN 
ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT WHICH ENCOURAGES ENTERPRISE-THE 
MAINSPRING OF PROSPERITY. OUR AIMS MUST BE:
 TO ACHIEVE PRICE STABILITY.
 TO KEEP FIRM CONTROL OVER PUBLIC SPENDING.
 TO CONTINUE TO REDUCE TAXES AS FAST AS WE PRUDENTLY CAN.
 TO MAKE SURE THAT MARKET MECHANISMS AND INCENTIVES ARE 
ALLOWED TO DO THEIR JOB.
    PRICE STABILITY DOES NOT MEAN A FROZEN ECONOMY IN WHICH NO 
PRICE EVER MOVES. BUT WE MUST DRIVE INFLATION DOWN SO LOW THAT 
IT NO LONGER AFFECTS THE DECISIONS MADE BY ORDINARY PEOPLE, 
BUSINESSES AND GOVERNMENT. WHEN INFLATION RISES, SO DO 
BANKRUPTCIES. WHEN INFLATION FALLS, INDUSTRY CAN PLAN AGAIN FOR A 
PROFITABLE FUTURE. INFLATION CREATES STRIFE, AS DIFFERENT GROUPS IN 
SOCIETY STRUGGLE TO RESTORE THEIR LIVING STANDARDS. IT DESTROYS 
JOBS. IT ERODES SAVINGS AND SOCIAL BENEFITS AND THREATENS OUR 
CURRENCY.
 
INFLATION AND EUROPE

MEMBERSHIP OF THE ERM IS NOW CENTRAL TO OUR COUNTER-INFLATION 
DISCIPLINE. BUT THE ERM IS NOT A MAGIC WAND. IT WOULD NOT 
PROTECT LABOUR, IT WOULD MERELY EXPOSE THE FOLLY OF LABOUR 
POLICIES. SOME LABOUR POLITICIANS KNOW THAT ALL TOO WELL-
OTHERS SIMPLY DON'T. THEY-AND SOME OF THE UNIONS- WOULD 
PUT IRRESISTIBLE SPENDING PRESSURE ON A LABOUR GOVERNMENT.  
   SOME MEMBERS OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITY ARE ANXIOUS TO 
HURRY ON FROM THE ERM TO ECONOMIC AND MONETARY UNION. 
OTHERS HAVE DOUBTS. QUITE APART FROM THE CONSTITUTIONAL ISSUES, 
THEY DO NOT WANT TO TAKE RISKS WITH WHAT IS BEING ACHIEVED IN 
THE ERM.  
   THE TREATY NEGOTIATED AT MAASTRICHT LAID DOWN THE PROCESS 
UNDER WHICH THE COMMUNITY CAN, IF ITS MEMBERS MEET CERTAIN 
ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, CREATE A MONETARY UNION WITH A SINGLE 
CURRENCY FOR SOME OR ALL OF THEM. TOGETHER WITH GERMANY, WE 
FOUGHT FOR TOUGH CRITERIA. WE BELIEVE A MONETARY UNION WOULD 
COLLAPSE, WITH DAMAGING CONSEQUENCES, IF IT WERE IMPOSED ON 
ECONOMIES THAT WERE TOO DIVERSE.  
   A UNION WILL ONLY COME ABOUT BY 1997 IF A SUBSTANTIAL 
MAJORITY OF COMMUNITY MEMBERS AGREE IT SHOULD. IT WOULD ONLY 
INCLUDE THOSE MEMBERS WHO WERE JUDGED TO HAVE MET SPECIFIED 
CONDITIONS. AND IT WOULD ONLY COME ABOUT IF A MAJORITY OF 
MEMBERS WERE JUDGED TO HAVE DONE SO.  
   BUT THE TREATY GOES ON TO SAY THAT MONETARY UNION WILL COME 
ABOUT AUTOMATICALLY IN 1999, FOR ALL WHO MEET THE CONDITIONS. 
WE DID NOT WANT TO EXCLUDE OURSELVES FROM MEMBERSHIP; BUT 
WE COULD NOT ACCEPT SUCH AN AUTOMATIC COMMITMENT. BY THE 
END OF THIS DECADE THE EC'S MEMBERSHIP WILL HAVE CHANGED; THE 
ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE OF MANY OF ITS MEMBERS MAY HAVE 
CHANGED. WE CANNOT TELL WHO THE MEMBERS OF SUCH A UNION 
MIGHT BE.  
   WE THEREFORE SECURED THE FREEDOM TO MAKE A PROPER 
JUDGEMENT ON EVENTS. WE ARE AS FREE TO JOIN IF WE WISH AS ANY 
OTHER MEMBER. WE WOULD HAVE TO MEET THE SAME CONDITIONS-
NO MORE, NO LESS. WE WILL PLAY OUR FULL PART IN THE DISCUSSIONS 
OF THE MONETARY INSTITUTIONS EUROPE MAY CREATE IN THE 1990S. 
BUT WE ARE NOT OBLIGED TO JOIN IN A SINGLE CURRENCY IF WE DO NOT 
WANT TO.
 IN DUE COURSE, WE WILL MOVE TO THE NARROW BANDS OF THE 
ERM.
 WE WILL PLAY OUR FULL PART IN THE DESIGN AND DISCUSSION OF 
MONETARY INSTITUTIONS FOR EUROPE.
 WHEN OR IF OTHER MEMBERS OF THE EC MOVE TO A MONETARY 
UNION WITH A SINGLE CURRENCY, WE WILL TAKE OUR OWN UNFETTERED 
DECISION ON WHETHER TO JOIN. THAT DECISION WILL BE TAKEN BY THE 
UNITED KINGDOM PARLIAMENT.
 
THE ROUTE TO LOWER TAXES

ECONOMIC GROWTH IS CREATED BY PEOPLE'S HARD WORK, INGENUITY, 
THRIFT AND WILLINGNESS TO TAKE RISKS. AN ENTERPRISE ECONOMY 
REWARDS THE INDUSTRIOUS AND THRIFTY. WE BELIEVE THAT 
GOVERNMENT SHOULD NOT GOBBLE UP ALL THE PROCEEDS OF GROWTH, 
AND THAT THOSE WHO CREATE PROSPERITY SHOULD ENJOY IT, THROUGH 
LOWER TAXES AND MORE OPPORTUNITY TO BUILD UP PERSONAL WEALTH.   
  OUR POLICY IS THEREFORE TO REDUCE THE SHARE OF NATIONAL INCOME 
TAKEN BY THE PUBLIC SECTOR. IN THE MID-1970S. PUBLIC SPENDING 
PEAKED AT OVER 49 PER CENT OF OUR GROSS NATIONAL PRODUCT. IN THE 
EARLY 1980S, IT PEAKED AT OVER 47 PER CENT. IN THIS RECESSION, IT IS 
PEAKING AT ONLY 43 PER CENT. WE AIM TO REDUCE THIS STEADILY AS 
THE RECOVERY GETS UNDER WAY.  
   KEEPING CONTROL OF PUBLIC SPENDING WILL ENABLE US TO CUT TAXES 
WHILE BRINGING THE GOVERNMENT'S BUDGET BACK TOWARDS BALANCE 
IN THE YEARS AHEAD. EXCESSIVE GOVERNMENT BORROWING CAN LEAD 
TO INFLATION. GOVERNMENT SHOULD ALWAYS HE ON GUARD AGAINST 
THAT DANGER. HOWEVER, WHEN DEMAND IN THE ECONOMY IS WEAK, 
PUBLIC BORROWING WILL TEND TO RISE.  
   BECAUSE COMPANIES PAY TAXES ACCORDING TO HOW WELL THEY DID 
THE PREVIOUS YEAR, THE DEFICIT TENDS TO BE DEEPEST JUST AS WE 
COME OUT OF RECESSION. WE MUST MAKE SURE THAT AS THE ECONOMY 
GROWS, BORROWING SLOWS.  
   BY BRINGING TAX AND SPENDING DECISIONS TOGETHER IN A UNIFIED 
BUDGET FROM NEXT YEAR, WE WILL MAKE THE CHOICES CLEARER. BUT 
LOWER TAXES AND A PRUDENT APPROACH TO BORROWING DO NOT MEAN 
PUBLIC SPENDING MUST FALL; QUITE THE REVERSE.  A LIGHTLY TAXED 
ECONOMY GENERATES MORE ECONOMIC GROWTH, AND MORE REVENUE.
  HIGH TAXES KILL THE GOOSE THAT LAYS THE GOLDEN EGGS.  IN THE 
COURSE OF ITS LAST FIVE YEARS IN OFFICE, LABOUR WAS FORCED TO CUT 
PUBLIC SPENDING, IN REAL TERMS.  BY CONTRAST, THE CONSERVATIVES 
HAVE BEEN ABLE TO RAISE PUBLIC SPENDING BY NEARLY A QUARTER IN 
REAL TERMS.
    HIGHER TAX RATES DO NOT ALWAYS BRING IN MORE MONEY. IN 
PRACTICE, THEY CAN BRING IN LESS. THE CONSERVATIVE GOVERNMENT 
HAS MORE THAN HALVED THE TOP RATE OF TAX. YET TOP RATE TAXPAYERS 
TODAY PROVIDE A BIGGER SHARE OF OUR TAX REVENUES THAN THEY DID 
BEFORE. LOWER TAXES HAVE ENCOURAGED MORE PEOPLE TO WORK 
HARDER-NOT TO SPEND THEIR TIME WORKING OUT HOW TO AVOID 
PENAL TAXES.  
   DURING THE PAST 13 YEARS WE HAVE CUT, SIMPLIFIED OR ABOLISHED 
A WHOLE RANGE OF DIRECT TAXES -WE HAVE CUT THE BASIC RATE OF 
INCOME TAX FROM 33P TO 25P, AND THE TOP RATE FROM 83P TO 40P 
-WE HAVE NOW ANNOUNCED A NEW STARTING INCOME TAX RATE OF 
20P. -WE HAVE RAISED THE BASIC SINGLE PERSON'S TAX ALLOWANCE 
BY 27 PER CENT MORE THAN WOULD BE NEEDED TO KEEP PACE WITH 
INFLATION.
 -WE HAVE SIMPLIFIED AND REDUCED THE BURDEN OF TAXATION ON 
CAPITAL.
-WE HAVE CUT CORPORATION TAX FROM 52 PER CENT TO 33 PER CENT 
(AND FROM 42 PER CENT TO 25 PER CENT FOR SMALL COMPANIES).
 -WE HAVE REDUCED THE BURDEN OF NATIONAL INSURANCE ON LOW 
EARNERS.
-WE HAVE INTRODUCED INDEPENDENT TAXATION OF HUSBANDS AND 
WIVES, GIVING MARRIED WOMEN FULL ELIGIBILITY FOR TAX 
ALLOWANCES.
 -WE HAVE INTRODUCED NEW TAX INCENTIVES FOR SAVINGS.
-WE HAVE ABOLISHED SEVERAL TAXES COMPLETELY, INCLUDING THE 
SURCHARGE ON INCOME FROM SAVINGS THE NATIONAL INSURANCE 
SURCHARGE, DEVELOPMENT LAND TAX, AND CAPITAL TRANSFER TAX. 
    WE ARE THE ONLY PARTY THAT UNDERSTANDS THE NEED FOR LOW 
TAXATION. LABOUR AND THE LIBERALS OPENLY ADVOCATE INCREASED 
TAXATION. YET LOWER TAXES CLEARLY CREATE A MORE PRODUCTIVE 
ECONOMY. THEY ALSO ACHIEVE ANOTHER PRIME OBJECTIVE OF 
CONSERVATIVE GOVERNMENTS, WHICH IS TO TRANSFER POWER FROM THE 
STATE TO THE PEOPLE. LABOUR WOULD: 
-REVERSE OUR CUT IN THE STARTING RATE OF INCOME TAX TO 20P. 
-RAISE THE TOP RATE. -ABOLISH THE NATIONAL INSURANCE CEILING. 
-INTRODUCE A NEW SAVINGS SURCHARGE. 
 WE ANNOUNCED IN THE BUDGET AN IMPORTANT FIRST STEP TOWARDS A 
BASIC INCOME TAX RATE OF 20P. BY APPLYING A 20P RATE TO THE FIRST 
£2,000 OF TAXABLE INCOME, WE HAVE CUT TAXES FOR ALL 25 MILLION 
TAXPAYERS, AND TAKEN THE FOUR MILLION ON LOWEST INCOMES OUT OF 
25P TAX ALTOGETHER.
 WE WILL MAKE FURTHER PROGRESS TOWARDS A BASIC INCOME TAX 
RATE OF 20P.
 WE WILL REDUCE THE SHARE OF NATIONAL INCOME TAKEN BY THE 
PUBLIC SECTOR.
 WE WILL SEE THE BUDGET RETURN TOWARDS BALANCE AS THE 
ECONOMY RECOVERS
. 
THE RIGHT TO OWN

SINCE 1979, WEALTH HAS BEEN SPREAD MORE WIDELY THROUGH THE 
COMMUNITY. HOME OWNERSHIP, SHARE OWNERSHIP AND THE BUILD-
UP OF PERSONAL PENSIONS HAVE ALL CONTRIBUTED. OVER TWO-THIRDS 
OF PEOPLE LIVE IN HOMES THAT THEY OWN, 10 MILLION PEOPLE OWN 
SHARES, SIX MILLION OF THEM IN NEWLY PRIVATISED INDUSTRIES. 
ABOUT 2.5 MILLION HAVE BENEFITED FROM TAX INCENTIVES TO 
ENCOURAGE EMPLOYEE SHARE SCHEMES. AND OVER 4.5 MILLION 
PEOPLE ARE NOW BUILDING UP THEIR OWN PERSONAL PENSIONS. BUT 
THESE FREEDOMS ARE AT RISK. LABOUR WOULD:
 -HALT THE PRIVATISATION PROGRAMME AND THREATEN THE VALUE OF 
SHARES IN PRIVATISED INDUSTRIES WITH RENATIONALISATION AND NEW 
GOVERNMENT CONTROLS.
 -BRING BACK CREDIT RATIONING, LEADING TO MORTGAGE QUEUES.
-TURN THE PENSIONS MARKET ON ITS HEAD, MAKING PENSION 
PROVISION COSTLY AND DIFFICULT. THESE CHANGES WOULD DRIVE 
SAVINGS OVERSEAS AND MAKE WEALTH AGAIN THE PREROGATIVE OF THE 
FEW.
     BY CONTRAST, WE WANT TO DO MORE TO ENCOURAGE THE WIDER 
DISTRIBUTION OF WEALTH THROUGHOUT SOCIETY. SUSTAINING NOT JUST A 
HOME-OWNING BUT A CAPITAL-OWNING DEMOCRACY IS CRUCIAL TO OUR 
VISION FOR THE 1990S. WE INTEND TO SPREAD THE OWNERSHIP OF 
SHARES, HOMES, PENSIONS AND SAVINGS. WE WILL DO SO THROUGH 
FUTURE PRIVATISATIONS, HELP FOR WOULD-BE HOME OWNERS IN COUNCIL 
TENANCIES AND FURTHER ENCOURAGEMENT FOR THE SPREAD OF PERSONAL 
PENSIONS. WE INTEND TO LIGHTEN THE BURDEN OF CAPITAL TAXES AND 
REFORM THE TAXATION OF SAVINGS. 
    WE BELIEVE INHERITANCE TAX IS PARTICULARLY INEQUITABLE. IT FALLS 
ONLY ON THOSE WHO DO NOT DISPOSE OF THEIR ASSETS SEVEN YEARS OR 
MORE BEFORE THEIR DEATH. IT IS INEVITABLY THE CASE THAT THESE TEND 
TO BE PEOPLE WHO ARE NOT RICH ENOUGH TO ENGAGE IN HIGH-
POWERED TAX PLANNING, OR WHO, FOR LACK OF KNOWLEDGE OR ADVICE, 
FAIL TO TAKE THE NECESSARY PRECAUTIONARY ACTION.  
   IN THE BUDGET, WE ANNOUNCED THAT WE WOULD TAKE MOST FAMILY 
BUSINESSES OUT OF INHERITANCE TAX ALTOGETHER. DURING THE NEW 
PARLIAMENT, WE WILL AIM TO LESSEN THE BURDEN ON FAMILIES TO 
WHOM HOME OWNERSHIP HAS BROUGHT THE THREAT OF THIS ERRATIC 
TAX.
 WE WILL AIM TO BRING HOME OWNERSHIP, SHARE OWNERSHIP AND 
PERSONAL PENSIONS WITHIN THE REACH OF MORE FAMILIES.
 WE WILL CONTINUE TO REFORM THE TAXATION OF SAVINGS, BUILDING 
ON THE SUCCESS OF PEPS AND TESSAS
 WE WILL RAISE THE TAX THRESHOLD FOR INHERITANCE TAX SO THAT THE 
HOMES AND SAVINGS OF AN INCREASING NUMBER OF OUR CITIZENS CAN 
PASS UNENCUMBERED FROM ONE GENERATION TO ANOTHER. 
 WHENEVER POSSIBLE, WE WILL ENSURE THAT FUTURE PRIVATISATIONS 
OFFER OPPORTUNITIES TO EMPLOYEES TO SECURE A STAKE IN THE 
OWNERSHIP OF THEIR BUSINESS. 
  WE WILL ENCOURAGE COMPANIES TO MAKE DEALING IN THEIR OWN 
SHARES EASIER, ESPECIALLY FOR SMALL SHAREHOLDERS, AND ENCOURAGE 
WIDER SHARE OWNERSHIP, THROUGH, FOR EXAMPLE, THE ESTABLISHMENT 
OF SHARE SHOPS.
 WE WILL ABOLISH STAMP DUTY ON SHARE TRANSACTIONS.
 
SETTING THE ECONOMY FREE

STARTING WITH THE ABOLITION OF EXCHANGE CONTROLS IN 1979, THE 
GOVERNMENT HAS CREATED NEW INCENTIVES FOR EVERY PART OF OUR 
ECONOMY. MANUFACTURING INDUSTRY SUFFERED PARTICULARLY BADLY 
FROM THE HARM INFLICTED ON THE BRITISH ECONOMY BY LABOUR 
GOVERNMENTS IN THE 1960S AND 1970S. TO A FAR GREATER EXTENT 
THAN SERVICE INDUSTRIES, IT WAS THE VICTIM OF MILITANT TRADES 
UNIONISM, RESTRICTIVE PRACTICES. NATIONALISATION, STATE 
INTERVENTION, TAX DISTORTION, PLANNING CONTROLS AND OVER-
REGULATION. WE BELIEVE STRONGLY THAT A VIGOROUS MANUFACTURING 
SECTOR IS ESSENTIAL TO A HEALTHY BRITISH ECONOMY. OVER THE PAST 
13 YEARS, WE HAVE STEADILY DISMANTLED BARRIERS TO ITS GROWTH.  
   THE COMPETITIVENESS AND PERFORMANCE OF BRITISH 
MANUFACTURING HAVE BEEN TRANSFORMED. ITS IMPRESSIVE RECOVERY 
WAS RECOGNISED BY THE CONFEDERATION OF BRITISH INDUSTRY, IN ITS 
REPORT APTLY TITLED COMPETING WITH THE WORLD'S BEST. 
MANUFACTURING PRODUCTIVITY HAS RISEN BY MORE THAN HALF SINCE 
1979-FASTER THAN IN ANY OTHER MAJOR INDUSTRIAL COUNTRY. OVER 
THE PAST 10 YEARS, BRITISH MANUFACTURED EXPORTS HAVE GROWN 
FASTER THAN THOSE OF FRANCE, GERMANY, THE UNITED STATES OR EVEN 
JAPAN. THE BRITISH MOTOR INDUSTRY HAS ACHIEVED AN ASTONISHING 
REVIVAL. BY 1996, BRITAIN SHOULD AGAIN BE EXPORTING MORE CARS 
THAN WE IMPORT-FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE 1974. WE HAVE GIVEN 
THE INDUSTRY YET MORE ENCOURAGEMENT IN THE BUDGET, BY HALVING 
THE SPECIAL TAX PAID ON NEW CARS. 
    THE BRITISH STANDARD FOR QUALITY MANAGEMENT HAS EFFECTIVELY 
BECOME THE INTERNATIONAL STANDARD. BUT THAT IS ONLY THE 
BEGINNING. WE HAVE SET UP A TEAM OF SENIOR BUSINESS PEOPLE TO 
PURSUE THE IDEA OF A NEW BRITISH QUALITY AWARD.  
   THE CITY IS EUROPE'S GREATEST FINANCIAL CENTRE. IT CONTRIBUTES 
£11,000 MILLION NET TO OUR BALANCE OF PAYMENTS. FINANCIAL 
SERVICES EMPLOY 12 PER CENT OF OUR WORKFORCE. LONDON'S CAPITAL 
MARKETS AND FINANCIAL SERVICES HAVE GROWN VIGOROUSLY BECAUSE 
THEY ARE INNOVATIVE AND HIGHLY COMPETITIVE. WE WILL CONTINUE 
OUR EFFORTS TO BREAK DOWN THE BARRIERS THAT PREVENT THEM FROM 
COMPETING FREELY THROUGHOUT EUROPE AND IN THE WIDER WORLD. 
THE EUROPEAN BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT IS 
NOW BASED IN LONDON. IT PUTS US IN THE FOREFRONT OF ENCOURAGING 
INVESTMENT IN THE DEVELOPING MARKETS OF CENTRAL AND EASTERN 
EUROPE.  
   SERVICE INDUSTRIES MAKE A VITAL CONTRIBUTION TO OUR ECONOMY 
AND TO OUR BALANCE OF PAYMENTS. TOURISM, FOR EXAMPLE, TODAY 
EMPLOYS 1.5 MILLION PEOPLE, 20 PER CENT MORE THAN IN 1980. IT IS 
AN INDUSTRY WHICH BOASTS MANY FAMOUS COMPANIES-BUT IT IS 
ALSO DRIVEN BY THE DYNAMISM OF MANY SMALL FIRMS. WE WILL 
CONTINUE TO HELP THEM BY SIMPLIFYING RULES AND REGULATIONS ON 
BUSINESS AND THROUGH THE DTI ENTERPRISE INITIATIVE AND A RANGE 
OF OTHER SCHEMES.
 WE WILL CONTINUE TO REDUCE TAX BURDENS ON BUSINESS, AS WE 
HAVE DONE THIS YEAR FOR THE MOTOR INDUSTRY, WHENEVER IT IS 
POSSIBLE TO DO SO.
 WE WILL ABOLISH UNNECESSARY LICENCES AND REDUCE THE NEED FOR 
SPECIFIC APPROVALS FOR PRODUCT DESIGN.
 WE WILL BACK BRITISH COMPANIES ENCOUNTERING ANY 
DISCRIMINATION, TRADE BARRIERS OR STATE SUBSIDIES THAT SHOULD NO 
LONGER EXIST WITHIN THE SINGLE MARKET.
 WE WILL BACK THE REGULATORS OF THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY 
IN THEIR EFFORTS TO ACHIEVE HIGH STANDARDS WHILE KEEPING THE RULE 
BOOKS DOWN TO MANAGEABLE SIZE.
 
PRIVATISATION

COMPETITION AND PRIVATE OWNERSHIP ARE THE MOST POWERFUL 
ENGINES OF ECONOMIC EFFICIENCY, INNOVATION AND CHOICE. THEY 
LEAD TO THE CREATION OF WORLD-CLASS COMPANIES. WE HAVE 
RETURNED TO PRIVATE ENTERPRISE TWO-THIRDS OF THE COMPANIES ONCE 
OWNED BY THE STATE: 46 BUSINESSES EMPLOYING ABOUT 900,000 
PEOPLE. THIS PROGRAMME HAS BEEN THE MODEL FOR GOVERNMENTS 
ACROSS THE WHOLE WORLD. THE WORK OF LIBERALISING MARKETS 
WHICH WERE ONCE MONOPOLISED GOES ON. IN 1984 WE PRIVATISED 
BRITISH TELECOM BUT ONLY MERCURY WAS GIVEN A LICENCE TO CARRY 
SERVICES OVER FIXED LINKS. IN 1991 WE DECIDED TO END THIS 
DUOPOLY. THE UK NOW HAS ONE OF THE MOST OPEN AND DYNAMIC 
TELECOMMUNICATIONS MARKETS IN THE WORLD.     BUT MUCH GREATER 
ECONOMIC EFFICIENCY IS NOT THE ONLY GAIN. EMPLOYEES HAVE BEEN 
ABLE TO TAKE A DIRECT STAKE IN THE NEWLY PRIVATISED COMPANIES. 
MILLIONS OF PEOPLE HAVE BEEN GIVEN THE SAME CHANCE TO OWN A 
REAL SHARE IN THE NATION'S ASSETS. COMPANIES WHICH LOOKED 
INWARDS TO WHITEHALL ARE NOW LISTENING TO THEIR CUSTOMERS AND 
SHAREHOLDERS.     SOME ACTIVITIES OF GOVERNMENT MUST ALWAYS BE 
PROVIDED IN THE PUBLIC SECTOR. BUT IN CENTRAL GOVERNMENT, NEXT 
STEPS AGENCIES AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT, MANAGEMENT IS 
INCREASINGLY BUYING IN SERVICES FROM THE PRIVATE SECTOR. OUR 
PROPOSALS FOR DEVELOPING THIS POLICY HAVE BEEN SET OUT IN THE 
WHITE PAPERS ON COMPETING FOR QUALITY IN CENTRAL AND LOCAL 
GOVERNMENT. 
 WE WILL CONTINUE OUR PRIVATISATION PROGRAMME. BRITISH COAL 
WILL BE RETURNED TO THE PRIVATE SECTOR. SO WILL LOCAL AUTHORITY 
BUS COMPANIES. WE WILL ENCOURAGE LOCAL AUTHORITIES TO SELL THEIR 
AIRPORTS. WE WILL END BRITISH RAIL'S MONOPOLY. WE WILL SELL 
CERTAIN RAIL SERVICES AND FRANCHISE OTHERS.
 THE PORTS ACT 1991 HAS PAVED THE WAY FOR THE PRIVATISATION OF 
THE TRUST PORTS BY COMPETITIVE TENDER. TEES AND HARTLEPOOL, 
TILBURY, MEDWAY, FORTH AND CLYDE HAVE ALREADY BEEN 
PRIVATISED.
 WE ARE PRIVATISING NORTHERN IRELAND ELECTRICITY AND WILL 
PRIVATISE THE NORTHERN IRELAND WATER AND SEWAGE SERVICES. WE 
WILL LOOK FOR WAYS OF BRINGING PRIVATE SECTOR SKILLS INTO THE 
MANAGEMENT OF NORTHERN IRELAND RAILWAYS.
 WE WILL BRING PRIVATE SECTOR ENTERPRISE INTO THE PUBLIC 
SERVICES 
 WE WILL REQUIRE ALL GOVERNMENT DEPARTMENTS TO REPORT 
ANNUALLY ON THEIR PLANS FOR MARKET-TESTING, AND PROGRESS IN 
ACHIEVING IT, IN THEIR OWN SERVICES AND IN THOSE OF THEIR 
ASSOCIATED AGENCIES.
 WE WILL MAINTAIN OUR PROGRAMME OF COMPULSORY COMPETITIVE 
TENDERING OF LOCAL AUTHORITY SERVICES. WE WILL ENSURE THAT UNFAIR 
TERMS ARE EXCLUDED AND WILL DISCOURAGE INVESTMENT TO PROTECT IN 
HOUSE SERVICES WHEN BETTER, MORE COST EFFECTIVE SERVICES ARE 
AVAILABLE THROUGH THE PRIVATE SECTOR.
 WE WILL ENSURE THAT COMPETITIVE TENDERING IS EXTENDED TO 
WHITE COLLAR LOCAL AUTHORITY SERVICES SUCH AS THOSE OFFERED BY 
LAWYERS, ACCOUNTANTS, ARCHITECTS AND SURVEYORS.
 WE WILL TACKLE ALL ANTI-COMPETITIVE AND RESTRICTIVE PRACTICES 
WITH VIGOUR. WE WILL INTRODUCE NEW LEGISLATION GIVING STRONGER 
POWERS TO DEAL WITH CARTELS.
 
  DEREGULATION

WE ARE CONCERNED THAT AT EVERY LEVEL OF GOVERNMENT-IN 
EUROPE, IN WHITEHALL AND IN LOCAL AUTHORITIES-SOME 
REGULATIONS MAY HAVE BEEN ADOPTED IN ANSWER TO LEGITIMATE 
CONCERNS, BUT WITHOUT PROPER REGARD TO THEIR OVERALL IMPACT ON 
BUSINESSES AND INDIVIDUALS. A PROPER BALANCE NEEDS TO BE STRUCK 
BETWEEN ESSENTIAL PROTECTION FOR THE PUBLIC, AND OVER-ZEALOUS 
AND INTRUSIVE CONTROLS AIMED AT THE ELIMINATION OF ALL 
CONCEIVABLE RISK. IT IS WRONG THAT NEW REGULATIONS, DESIGNED TO 
DEAL WITH ISOLATED PROBLEMS, SHOULD INTERFERE WITH THE PRIVATE 
ARRANGEMENTS OF CITIZENS OR WITH REASONABLE COMMERCIAL 
PRACTICES THAT HAVE EARNED BROAD PUBLIC ACCEPTANCE.
 THE COMPLIANCE COSTS OF NEW UK AND EC REGULATIONS MUST BE 
ASSESSED PROPERLY. EXISTING REGULATIONS WHICH ARE OUTMODED 
AND BURDENSOME MUST BE SIMPLIFIED OR REMOVED. WE WILL GIVE 
PRIORITY TO THE WORK OF THE DTI DEREGULATION UNIT IN THESE AREAS.
 WE WILL EXAMINE WAYS IN WHICH THE UNIFORM SCOPE OF 
REGULATION COULD BE EASED TO SAFEGUARD TRADITIONAL LOCAL 
PRODUCTS OR PRACTICES.
 WE WILL EXAMINE WHETHER CERTAIN REGULATIONS AFFECTING 
INDIVIDUAL CITIZENS WITHIN THEIR OWN HOMES COULD BE MADE 
ADVISORY, RATHER THAN MANDATORY.
 
  ENERGY

OUR ENERGY POLICIES HAVE BROUGHT THE CONSUMER BOTH LOWER 
PRICES AND BETTER SERVICE. WE HAVE PRIVATISED BRITISH GAS AND 
THE ELECTRICITY INDUSTRY IN A WAY THAT HAS OPENED THESE MARKETS 
TO COMPETITION. THESE POLICIES ARE NOW BEING SEIZED UPON IN 
EUROPE AS ESSENTIAL EXTENSIONS OF THE SINGLE MARKET. DOMESTIC 
CUSTOMERS ARE NOW PROTECTED BY A PRICE FORMULA, AND HIGH 
STANDARDS OF SERVICE ARE ENFORCED BY THE INDEPENDENT REGULATORS. 
FOR INSTANCE, ELECTRICITY DISCONNECTIONS FOR DEBT HAVE FALLEN BY 
43 PER CENT SINCE THE LAUNCH OF PRIVATISATION.  
   WE HAVE ENSURED THAT THE SAFETY OF EMPLOYEES COMES FIRST, 
AND HAVE GIVEN THOUSANDS THE OPPORTUNITY OF ACQUIRING A STAKE 
IN THEIR INDUSTRY.   
  THE FUTURE OF THE COAL INDUSTRY DEPENDS CRUCIALLY ON THE 
COMPETITIVENESS OF COAL AS A FUEL FOR ELECTRICITY GENERATION. 
BRITISH COAL HAS MADE ENORMOUS PROGRESS IN INCREASING 
PRODUCTIVITY SINCE THE END OF THE 1985 STRIKE-BUT THERE IS STILL 
FURTHER TO GO. WE WILL SUPPORT THE EFFORTS OF BRITISH COAL AND ITS 
WORKFORCE TO IMPROVE THE INDUSTRY'S PERFORMANCE. THE LONG-
TERM FUTURE OF THE INDUSTRY LIES IN THE PRIVATE SECTOR. WE HAVE 
INVESTED IN CLEAN COAL TECHNOLOGY TO SAFEGUARD THE ENVIRONMENT. 
RENEWABLE ENERGY PROJECTS HAVE RECEIVED UNPRECEDENTED 
SUPPORT. NORTH SEA OIL AND GAS ARE ENJOYING A RECORD EXPANSION 
THANKS TO OUR POLICIES OF DEREGULATION AND LOW TAXATION.
 SAFETY WILL REMAIN OUR HIGHEST PRIORITY THROUGHOUT THE ENERGY 
SECTOR.
 WE WILL CONTINUE TO ENCOURAGE COMPETITION IN ENERGY 
MARKETS. WE WILL PROGRESSIVELY REDUCE THE BRITISH GAS 
MONOPOLY OF THE RETAIL GAS MARKET, TO GIVE SMALL USERS THE SAME 
RIGHTS AS BIG FIRMS.
 WE WILL PRIVATISE BRITISH COAL IN A WAY THAT ENABLES 
EMPLOYEES TO ENJOY A STAKE IN THE INDUSTRY. ! WE WILL INCREASE 
OUR SUPPORT FOR BRITISH COAL ENTERPRISE WHICH PROMOTES 
ECONOMIC REGENERATION M AREAS AFFECTED BY THE CLOSURE OF 
MINES, AND HAS SUCCESSFULLY ASSISTED 76,000 PEOPLE IN FINDING 
NEW JOBS.
 WE WILL REVIEW THE FUTURE OF THE NUCLEAR INDUSTRY IN 1994. 
WE ARE COMMITTED TO SAFE AND ECONOMICAL NUCLEAR POWER. THE 
EXISTING STRICT ARRANGEMENTS FOR NUCLEAR WASTE WILL BE 
MAINTAINED.
 WE WILL MAINTAIN A GUARANTEED MARKET FOR RENEWABLE ENERGY 
PROJECTS AND FUND RESEARCH IN THIS AREA.
 WE WILL CONSULT ON NEW BUILDING REGULATIONS TO IMPROVE 
ENERGY USE. TOGETHER WITH BRITISH GAS AND SOME OF THE REGIONAL 
ELECTRICITY COMPANIES, WE WILL ESTABLISH AN INDEPENDENT ENERGY 
SAVINGS TRUST TO PROMOTE ENERGY EFFICIENCY. OUR GRANTS SCHEME 
FOR LOW INCOME HOUSEHOLDS WILL RECEIVE RECORD FUNDING NEXT 
YEAR
. 
  SCIENCE AND INNOVATION

  BRITISH SCIENCE HAS AN UNRIVALLED REPUTATION FOR GROUND-
BREAKING RESEARCH. WE BELIEVE IN INVESTING IN SCIENTIFIC 
RESEARCH BECAUSE IT ENRICHES THE QUALITY OF OUR LIVES AND 
PROVIDES THE FEEDSTOCK OF INDUSTRIAL INNOVATION. THE SCIENCE 
BUDGET HAS GROWN BY 24 PER CENT IN REAL TERMS SINCE 1978-9. 
INCREASINGLY, FUNDING WILL REFLECT THE QUALITY OF THE RESEARCH 
OUTPUT SO THAT THE BEST CENTRES CAN TRULY BE WORLD LEADERS. THE 
GOVERNMENT SPENDS NEARLY £3,000 MILLION A YEAR ON CIVIL 
RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT-AT LEAST AS HIGH A PROPORTION OF 
NATIONAL INCOME AS THE JAPANESE OR AMERICANS. AND SINCE 1978, 
BRITISH INDUSTRY'S SPENDING ON R&D HAS INCREASED BY 37 PER 
CENT IN REAL TERMS
. WE WILL CONTINUE TO SUPPORT OUR SCIENCE BASE TO MAINTAIN THE 
EXCELLENCE OF OUR SCIENCE AND TO ENSURE THAT WE PRODUCE THE 
SKILLED TECHNICAL PEOPLE WE NEED.
 WE WILL ENCOURAGE THE TRANSFER OF PEOPLE AND TECHNOLOGY 
FROM UNIVERSITIES TO BUSINESSES AND UPGRADE THE LINK SCHEME, 
WHICH FUNDS JOINT RESEARCH.
 WE WILL ENCOURAGE THE ESTABLISHMENT OF CENTRES OF 
TECHNOLOGICAL EXCELLENCE LINKING INDUSTRIAL RESEARCH 
ORGANISATIONS WITH UNIVERSITIES AND POLYTECHNICS.
 WE WILL CONTINUE TO DEVELOP NEW INNOVATION SCHEMES FOR 
SMALL AND MEDIUM-SIZED BUSINESSES, INCLUDING THE HIGHLY 
REGARDED SPUR PROGRAMME TO PROVIDE HELP WITH THE 
DEVELOPMENT OF NEW PRODUCTS AND PROCESSES.
 
REGIONAL POLICIES

IN RECENT YEARS, THE UNITED KINGDOM HAS ATTRACTED FIVE TIMES AS 
MUCH JAPANESE INVESTMENT AS GERMANY OR FRANCE, WHICH 
POWERFULLY DEMONSTRATES THAT WE HAVE CREATED THE MOST 
ATTRACTIVE ENVIRONMENT IN EUROPE FOR INVESTORS. OUR POSITIVE 
POLICY TOWARDS INWARD INVESTMENT WILL BE MAINTAINED, IN 
CONTRAST TO THAT OF THE TUC AND THE LABOUR PARTY. THE 
GOVERNMENT WILL CONTINUE TO INVEST IN A STRONG INFRASTRUCTURE 
AND BOOST TECHNOLOGY EXPERTISE IN THE REGIONS.
 WE WILL ENSURE THAT REGIONAL POLICY IS WELL TARGETED.
 WE WILL CONTINUE TO SUPPORT ALL PARTS OF THE UNITED KINGDOM 
IN THEIR CAMPAIGNS TO ATTRACT INWARD INVESTMENT.
 WE WILL GIVE ADDITIONAL EMPHASIS TO UPGRADING SKILLS AND 
TECHNOLOGY WHEN ALLOCATING FUNDS. 
SMALL BUSINESSES

SMALL BUSINESSES ARE THE SEEDCORN OF THE ECONOMY. THEIR 
NUMBERS HAVE GROWN BY MORE THAN A THIRD SINCE 1979, WHILE THE 
NUMBER OF SELF-EMPLOYED PEOPLE HAS GROWN TO OVER 12 PER CENT 
OF THE WORKFORCE. WE WILL CONTINUE TO RECOGNISE THE SPECIAL 
NEEDS OF SMALL AND MEDIUM-SIZED COMPANIES, AND TO ENSURE THAT 
GOVERNMENT DELIVERS USEFUL SERVICES TO THEM. OUR TAX REGIME 
FOR SMALL BUSINESSES IS ONE OF THE MOST FAVOURABLE IN EUROPE. 
WE HAVE RAISED THE VAT THRESHOLD EVERY YEAR SINCE 1979 AND 
REDUCED THE SMALL COMPANIES RATE OF CORPORATION TAX FROM 42 
PER CENT TO 25 PER CENT. 
   TRAINING AND ENTERPRISE COUNCILS (AND LOCAL ENTERPRISE 
COMPANIES IN SCOTLAND) HAVE DEVELOPED A WIDE RANGE OF 
SERVICES FOR BUSINESS AND ENTERPRISE WHICH ASSIST OVER 150,000 
SMALL COMPANIES EACH YEAR. WE HAVE DEVELOPED THE POPULAR 
ENTERPRISE INITIATIVE, UNDER WHICH 40,000 COMPANIES HAVE BEEN 
HELPED TO BUY IN OUTSIDE EXPERTISE OFFERING KEY MANAGEMENT 
SKILLS. WE NOW PROPOSE TO DEVELOP THIS INITIATIVE FURTHER.    WE 
ALSO PROPOSE TO HELP BUSINESSES BY EASING THE TRANSFER OF 
COMMERCIAL TENANCIES.
 WE ANNOUNCED IN THE BUDGET NEW MEASURES TO HELP SMALL 
BUSINESSES, INCLUDING FULL RELIEF AGAINST INHERITANCE TAX ON MOST 
BUSINESS ASSETS, REDUCTIONS IN BUSINESS RATES AND PROPOSALS TO 
SPEED UP THE PAYMENT OF OUTSTANDING BILLS. 
  DURING THE NEW PARLIAMENT, WE WILL DEVELOP A NEW ENTERPRISE 
SERVICE TO GIVE SMALL AND MEDIUM SIZED COMPANIES HELP IN 
DIAGNOSING THEIR MOST IMPORTANT STRATEGIC NEEDS. A NEW 
CONSULTANCY BROKERAGE SERVICE WILL SUPPLY INFORMATION TO SMALL 
COMPANIES. WE WILL ALSO DEVELOP A TECHNOLOGY AUDIT WHICH WILL 
PROVIDE SMALL FIRMS WITH A PLAN FOR CHANGE. AND WE WILL 
CONTINUE TO SUPPORT TOTAL QUALITY MANAGEMENT CONSULTANCIES. 
TECS AND LECS WILL BE CLOSELY INVOLVED IN DEVELOPING AND 
IMPLEMENTING THIS NEW INITIATIVE.    THE INDEPENDENT LAW 
COMMISSION HAS RECOMMENDED THAT A COMMERCIAL TENANT 
SHOULD IN GENERAL BE FREED FROM ANY FUTURE LIABILITY UNDER A 
LEASE WHEN HE ASSIGNS AWAY HIS INTEREST UNDER IT. WE WILL 
CONSIDER HOW THIS PRINCIPLE COULD BE PUT INTO EFFECT FOR NEW 
COMMERCIAL LEASES. 

CONSUMER AFFAIRS

CONSUMERS WANT CHOICE, QUALITY AND VALUE FOR MONEY. 
COMPETITION ONLY WORKS EFFECTIVELY IF CONSUMERS HAVE THE 
INFORMATION THEY NEED TO MAKE SENSIBLE DECISIONS. OUR FOOD 
SAFETY POLICY PROMOTES CONSUMER CHOICE AND CONSUMER SAFETY. 
WE INTRODUCED THE 1990 FOOD SAFETY ACT TO E SURE THE HIGHEST 
STANDARDS OF FOOD HYGIENE.  
  WE WILL INTRODUCE LEGISLATION DESIGNED TO GIVE CONSUMERS 
CONFIDENCE THAT WHAT THEY PURCHASE IS PROPERLY DESCRIBED-AND 
THAT ADEQUATE COMPENSATION IS OFFERED WHERE THESE 
REQUIREMENTS ARE NOT MET. WE WILL ENABLE THE COURTS TO OVERRIDE 
UNFAIR TERMS IN CONTRACTS AND IMPROVE OUR POWERS TO DEAL WITH 
ROGUE TRADERS. WE WILL ENSURE THAT GUARANTEES MEAN WHAT THEY 
SAY, AND THAT MANUFACTURERS OR IMPORTERS SHARE RESPONSIBILITY 
WITH THE PEOPLE WHO SELL THEIR GOODS.

 WE WILL TIGHTEN UP THE RULES ON HOLIDAY BROCHURES AND 
CONTRACTS, AND INTRODUCE A COOLING-OFF PERIOD INTO TIMESHARE 
CONTRACTS.
 WE WILL INTRODUCE LEGISLATION TO SIMPLIFY TRADE MARK 
REGISTRATION AND EXTEND THE RIGHTS THEY CONFER.
 WE WILL ENFORCE SCIENCE-BASED CONTROLS ON THE USE OF 
CHEMICALS IN FOOD PRODUCTION AND WILL MAINTAIN OUR POLICY OF 
OPEN ACCESS TO INFORMATION ON PESTICIDE SAFETY.
 WE WILL IMPROVE STANDARDS OF FOOD LABELLING IN CLOSE 
CONSULTATION WITH CONSUMER REPRESENTATIVES 

CHOICE AND THE CHARTER

THE CITIZEN'S CHARTER IS THE MOST FAR-REACHING PROGRAMME EVER 
DEVISED TO IMPROVE QUALITY IN PUBLIC SERVICES. IT ADDRESSES THE 
NEEDS OF THOSE WHO USE PUBLIC SERVICES. EXTENDS PEOPLE'S RIGHTS, 
REQUIRES SERVICES TO SET DEAR STANDARDS-AND TO TELL THE PUBLIC 
HOW FAR THOSE STANDARDS ARE MET.  
   THE CITIZEN'S CHARTER: -WIDENS POPULAR CHOICE; -HELPS 
PEOPLE TO EXERCISE THAT CHOICE IN A PROPERLY INFORMED WAY; 
-EXPECTS ALL PUBLIC SERVICES TO PUT THE CUSTOMER FIRST; 
-PROMOTES THE CHALLENGE OF COMPETITION WITHIN THE PUBLIC 
SECTOR;
-REQUIRES CLEAR PERFORMANCE STANDARDS TO BE SET AND FOR 
SERVICES TO BE MEASURED AGAINST THEM;
-INSISTS ON A PROPER RESPONSE TO COMPLAINTS AND ON ACTION TO 
SET RIGHT THE PROBLEMS BEHIND THEM.  
   THE CHARTER WILL BE AT THE CENTRE OF GOVERNMENT'S DECISION-
MAKING THROUGHOUT THE 1990S. NO ONE DOUBTS THE 
PROFESSIONALISM OF THE VAST MAJORITY OF PUBLIC SERVANTS. BUT TOO 
OFTEN THE SYSTEM'S OUTDATED WORKING METHODS AND ATTITUDES 
PREVENT THEM FROM GIVING THEIR BEST. THE CHARTER'S COMMITMENT 
TO MODERN, OPEN SERVICES WILL HELP THEM TO WIN THE RESPECT THAT 
GOOD SERVICE DESERVES.  
   IN LESS THAN A YEAR SINCE THE WHITE PAPER, 18 DETAILED CHARTERS 
HAVE BEEN PUBLISHED. EACH SETS OUT TOUGH NEW STANDARDS AND 
GIVES NEW INFORMATION AND RIGHTS TO THE PUBLIC. EACH WILL BE 
REVISED REGULARLY TO CHECK ON PROGRESS, AND RAISE STANDARDS 
HIGHER. BUT, ALREADY, RESULTS ARE DEAR. -IN HOSPITALS, FROM 
APRIL, EVERY OUT-PATIENT WILL HAVE A FIXED APPOINTMENT TIME AND 
OUR GUARANTEE OF MAXIMUM WAITING TIMES FOR OPERATIONS WILL BE 
STEADILY IMPROVED. -ON COUNCIL ESTATES EVERY TENANT WILL HAVE 
THE RIGHT TO CALL IN A PRIVATE CONTRACTOR IF THE COUNCIL FAILS TO DO 
A MINOR REPAIR. -IN SCHOOLS, ALL PARENTS WILL HAVE THE RIGHT TO A 
REPORT ON THEIR CHILD'S PERFORMANCE AND DETAILS ON THAT OF THE 
SCHOOL. 
    RIGHTS SUCH AS THESE SHOULD NOT HAVE BEEN DENIED TO THE 
PUBLIC. THE CITIZEN'S CHARTER, STEADILY BUT SURELY, IS CHANGING 
ALL THAT.
 
KNOWLEDGE, STANDARDS, CHOICE

THE NEXT CONSERVATIVE GOVERNMENT WILL CARRY THE CHARTER STILL 
FURTHER. THERE WILL BE MORE INFORMATION ABOUT STANDARDS AND 
PERFORMANCE; CLEAR STANDARDS SET WITHIN PUBLIC SERVICES WHICH 
ARE STILL SHROUDED IN MYSTERY; MORE CHOICE BUILT INTO PUBLIC 
SERVICES AND PROPER COMPLAINTS PROCEDURES INTRODUCED. MANY OF 
THESE ARE OUTLINED LATER IN THE MANIFESTO UNDER EDUCATION, 
HEALTH, LOCAL GOVERNMENT AND TRANSPORT. HERE ARE A FEW 
EXAMPLES FROM THE PROGRAMME FOR THE NEXT TWO YEARS:
 THE AUDIT COMMISSION WILL BE ABLE TO PUBLISH LEAGUE TABLES 
OF PERFORMANCE INCLUDING EACH LOCAL COUNCIL AND HEALTH 
AUTHORITY SO THAT PEOPLE CAN COMPARE THE QUALITY OF SERVICE. 
WE WILL ENSURE THAT INSPECTION REPORTS ARE PUBLISHED AND WIDELY 
AVAILABLE. ALL COUNCILS WILL HAVE TO RESPOND IN PUBLIC TO 
CRITICISM FROM AUDITORS
. WE WILL INTRODUCE A NEW 'CHARTERLINE' THAT PEOPLE WITH 
QUESTIONS OR PROBLEMS WITH A PUBLIC SERVICE WILL BE ABLE TO RING.
 WE WILL REQUIRE BRITISH RAIL TO TIGHTEN ITS TARGETS FOR 
RELIABILITY AND PUNCTUALITY ON ALL LINES, AND REPORT MONTHLY TO 
PASSENGERS ON HOW IT IS DOING. LONDON UNDERGROUND WILL 
PUBLISH ITS OWN CHARTER.
 WE WILL EXPECT POST OFFICES AND JOB CENTRES TO SET OUT 
STANDARDS OF SERVICE AND LEVELS OF ACHIEVEMENT.
 A NEW CHARTER MARK AWARD WILL GIVE RECOGNITION TO THOSE 
PARTS OF THE PUBLIC SERVICE THAT BEST MEET CHARTER STANDARDS.
 BRITISH RAIL AND LONDON UNDERGROUND ARE INTRODUCING 
COMPENSATION SYSTEMS FOR TRAVELLERS.
 WE WILL REVIEW THE POWERS OF THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT 
OMBUDSMAN TO ENSURE THAT FINDINGS OF MALADMINISTRATION ARE 
PROPERLY DEALT WITH BY ALL LOCAL AUTHORITIES.
 WE WILL CONSULT ON A NEW LAY ADJUDICATORS SCHEME TO HELP 
THE PUBLIC RESOLVE DIFFICULTIES AND DISPUTES.  
   WE WILL EXTEND COMPETITION AND ACCOUNTABILITY IN PUBLIC 
SERVICES. THOSE WHO PROVIDE PUBLIC SERVICES WILL HAVE TO PROVE 
THEY CAN GIVE THE RIGHT QUALITY AT THE RIGHT COST.
 WE WILL EXTEND COMPULSORY COMPETITIVE TENDERING TO LOCAL 
AUTHORITY HOUSING MANAGEMENT, AND EXAMINE HOW TO APPLY IT TO 
WHITE-COLLAR SERVICES.
 WE WILL ACT TO ENSURE THAT PRIVATE FIRMS BIDDING TO IMPROVE 
LOCAL AUTHORITY PUBLIC SERVICES ARE NOT OBSTRUCTED BY 
UNSCRUPULOUS PRACTICES IN COUNCILS OR BY UNFAIR CONTRACTS. 
 WE WILL PURSUE MORE COMPETITIVE TENDERING FOR CENTRAL 
GOVERNMENT SERVICES.
 WE WILL ENCOURAGE THE WIDER USE OF PERFORMANCE PAY INSIDE 
THE CIVIL SERVICE AND IN OTHER PARTS OF THE PUBLIC SERVICE. A LINK 
BETWEEN A PERSON'S EFFORT AND HIS OR HER PAY IS A POWERFUL 
MEANS OF IMPROVING PERFORMANCE.
 CIVIL SERVANTS DEALING WITH THE PUBLIC WILL NORMALLY IDENTIFY 
THEMSELVES BY NAME.
 WE WILL TOUGHEN INSPECTION OF KEY PUBLIC SERVICES WHERE 
CHOICE AND COMPETITION MUST INEVITABLY BE LIMITED. WE WILL 
INTRODUCE, FOR THE FIRST TIME. REGULAR INDEPENDENT INSPECTION OF 
ALL SCHOOLS
 WE WILL ACT TO ENSURE THAT THE INSPECTORATES OF POLICE, FIRE, 
PROBATION, AND SOCIAL SERVICES, TOGETHER WITH ANY NEW 
INSPECTORATES THAT ARE ESTABLISHED, WILL BE TRULY INDEPENDENT OF 
THE SERVICE WHICH THEY INSPECT.
 WE WILL ENSURE THAT THE REPORTS FROM THESE SYSTEMATIC REGULAR 
INSPECTIONS ARE PUBLISHED. MORE LAY INSPECTORS, DRAWN FROM 
OTHER PROFESSIONS AND FROM THE GENERAL PUBLIC, WILL BRING FRESH 
INSIGHTS INTO SERVICE IMPROVEMENT.
 WE WILL PUBLISH LATER THIS YEAR NEW PROPOSALS FOR THE 
INSPECTION OF SOCIAL WORK IN ENGLAND, SETTING UP ARRANGEMENTS 
FOR SYSTEMATIC INDEPENDENT INSPECTION OF ALL CARE SERVICES AND 
EVERY LOCAL AUTHORITY SOCIAL SERVICES DEPARTMENT.
 INSPECTIONS OF LOCAL AUTHORITY HOMES WILL BE CARRIED OUT BY 
TEAMS THAT CONTAIN LAY INSPECTORS AND ARE INDEPENDENT OF THE 
INFLUENCE OF THE MANAGEMENT OF THE HOMES.  
   ALL OF THE PRIVATISED UTILITIES HAVE A SPECIALIST REGULATOR WHO 
IS RESPONSIBLE FOR PROMOTING COMPETITION, REVIEWING PRICES AND 
PROTECTING THE PUBLIC INTEREST. WE HAVE INTRODUCED LEGISLATION TO 
INCREASE THE POWERS OF THESE REGULATORS TO THE LEVEL OF THE 

STRONGEST.
 WE ARE ENSURING THAT THE REGULATORS HAVE THE POWERS THEY 
NEED TO PROMOTE COMPETITION AND SAFEGUARD THE INTERESTS OF THE 
CUSTOMER BY CONTROLLING PRICE INCREASES. WE WILL INCREASE 
COMPETITION IN THE GAS AND WATER MARKETS.
 WE ARE GIVING THE REGULATORS POWERS TO SET STANDARDS OF 
SERVICE, COVERING SUCH MATTERS AS FIXED APPOINTMENT TIMES FOR 
SERVICE CALLS.
 
THE POST OFFICE

THE POST OFFICE IS AMONG THE BEST IN EUROPE FOR SPEED AND 
RELIABILITY OF ITS LETTER SERVICES. TRAFFIC HAS GROWN BY 50 PER 
CENT IN A DECADE IN WHICH IT HAS OPERATED WITHOUT A SUBSIDY. 
LAST YEAR THE FIRST-CLASS LETTER SERVICE ACHIEVED RECORD 
IMPROVEMENTS IN RELIABILITY. THE LOCAL POST OFFICE IS A VITAL AND 
VALUED FEATURE OF THE RURAL COMMUNITY. IN 1981 WE INTRODUCED 
PRIVATE COMPETITION FOR DELIVERIES COSTING OVER £1. THIS LED TO 
THE RAPID GROWTH OF THE PRIVATE COURIER INDUSTRY, WITH 
SUBSTANTIAL BENEFITS TO BUSINESS USERS. WE BELIEVE THAT FURTHER 
BENEFITS TO CONSUMERS WOULD FLOW FROM ADDITIONAL COMPETITION.
 WE ARE COMMITTED TO MAINTAINING A NATION-WIDE LETTER SERVICE 
WITH DELIVERY TO EVERY ADDRESS IN THE UNITED KINGDOM, WITHIN A 
UNIFORM STRUCTURE OF PRICES, AND WITH A NATION-WIDE NETWORK OF 
POST OFFICES.
 WE WILL LEGISLATE TO SET UP A NEW INDEPENDENT REGULATOR TO 
ADVISE ON ISSUES AFFECTING POST OFFICE CUSTOMERS, AND ON THE 
PROGRESSIVE INTRODUCTION OF COMPETITION.
 WE WILL SET PERFORMANCE TARGETS FOR THE POST OFFICE AND 
ENSURE THEY ARE PUBLISHED IN ALL OFFICES, TOGETHER WITH RESULTS 
ACHIEVED.
 WE WILL ENSURE THERE IS EFFECTIVE REDRESS FOR CUSTOMERS WHERE 
SERVICES FAIL.
 WE WILL LOWER THE LIMIT ON THE POST OFFICE MONOPOLY MUCH 
CLOSE TO THE LEVEL OF THE FIRST CLASS STAMP.
 WE WILL PROVIDE IMPROVED SCOPE FOR CONTRACTORS TO CARRY MAIL 
TO FINAL DELIVERY OFFICES. WE WILL CONSIDER REQUESTS TO LICENSE 
LIMITED SPECIALIST SERVICES TO COMPETE WITHIN THE POST OFFICE 
MONOPOLY.
 
WHITEHALL & WESTMINSTER

WHITEHALL MUST MOVE WITH THE TIMES. IT IS OVER A DECADE SINCE 
THE LAST MAJOR RESTRUCTURING OF THE DEPARTMENTS OF GOVERNMENT. 
SINCE THEN: -TWO-THIRDS OF THE STATE INDUSTRIAL SECTOR HAS BEEN 
PRIVATISED, TRANSFERRING ABOUT 900,000 JOBS TO THE PRIVATE SECTOR. 
-GOVERNMENT HAS REDUCED THE BURDEN OF REGULATION AND THE 
NEED FOR CENTRAL BUREAUCRACY. -CIVIL SERVICE MANPOWER HAS 
BEEN REDUCED BY ALMOST A QUARTER. -MANY OF THE FUNCTIONS OF 
GOVERNMENT HAVE BEEN DEVOLVED FROM WHITEHALL
-THE CITIZEN'S CHARTER PROGRAMME IS BRINGING NEW QUALITY TO 
PUBLIC SERVICES. 
    WE WILL CONTINUE TO REORGANISE CENTRAL GOVERNMENT IN TUNE 
WITH ITS MODERN ROLE, WHILE DEVOLVING AND CONTRACTING-OUT 
EXECUTIVE FUNCTIONS. WE WANT TO ENSURE THAT THE DRIVE TO SAVE 
MONEY, TO REDUCE BUREAUCRACY AND RAISE QUALITY IS POWERFULLY 
LED FROM THE CENTRE OF GOVERNMENT.
 WE WILL GIVE A CABINET MINISTER RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE 
CITIZEN'S CHARTER PROGRAMME AND REFORMING THE CIVIL SERVICE, 
TAKING CHARGE OF THE CITIZEN'S CHARTER UNIT, EFFICIENCY UNIT, THE 
PROGRAMME FOR CREATING AGENCIES AND THE PUBLIC COMPETITION 
AND PURCHASING UNIT. THIS WILL MAKE IT EASIER TO RAISE QUALITY 
AND EFFICIENCY IN GOVERNMENT AND SEE THAT CONTRACTING-OUT AND 
MARKET TESTING ARE ENERGETICALLY PURSUED.

 WE INTEND TO CREATE A NEW DEPARTMENT, UNDER A CABINET 
MINISTER, WITH RESPONSIBILITY FOR BROADCASTING, ARTS. SPORT, 
TOURISM. THE NATIONAL HERITAGE AND THE FILM INDUSTRY. THIS 
DEPARTMENT WILL AIM TO ENCOURAGE PRIVATE SECTOR ENTERPRISE IN 
ALL THESE FIELDS. THE NATIONAL LOTTERY AND THE MILLENNIUM FUND 
WILL ALSO BRING NEW RESPONSIBILITIES TO GOVERNMENT IN THESE 
AREAS.
 WE WILL TRANSFER THE CORE RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE DEPARTMENT 
OF ENERGY TO THE DEPARTMENT OF TRADE AND INDUSTRY AND 
RESPONSIBILITIES FOR ENERGY EFFICIENCY TO THE DEPARTMENT OF THE 
ENVIRONMENT, ENDING THE NEED FOR A SEPARATE DEPARTMENT.
 SMALL BUSINESSES ARE THE SEEDCORN OF OUR FUTURE PROSPERITY. 
WE BELIEVE THE DEPARTMENT OF TRADE AND INDUSTRY SHOULD TAKE 
OVER RESPONSIBILITY FOR THEM. WE ALSO WANT TO STRENGTHEN THE 
LINKS BETWEEN THE DTI AND THE HIGHLY SUCCESSFUL TRAINING AND 
ENTERPRISE COUNCILS.
 RESPONSIBILITY FOR OVERSEEING ALL FINANCIAL SERVICES WILL BE 
BROUGHT TOGETHER IN THE TREASURY, IN LINE WITH THE PRACTICE 
ADOPTED IN MOST OTHER ADVANCED COUNTRIES.
 NEW PROGRAMMES FOR REGENERATING OUR INNER CITIES ARE 
OUTLINED IN THIS MANIFESTO. RESPONSIBILITIES WILL BE BROUGHT 
TOGETHER IN THE DEPARTMENT OF THE ENVIRONMENT.
 WE ARE DETERMINED TO ENSURE THAT WOMEN IN THE WORK-FORCE 
REALISE THEIR FULL POTENTIAL. WE WILL TRANSFER FROM THE HOME 
OFFICE TO THE DEPARTMENT OF EMPLOYMENT THE LEAD 
RESPONSIBILITY FOR CO-ORDINATING GOVERNMENT POLICY ON ISSUES OF 
PARTICULAR CONCERN TO WOMEN.
 
OPEN GOVERNMENT

GOVERNMENT HAS TRADITIONALLY BEEN FAR TOO RELUCTANT TO PROVIDE 
INFORMATION. THIS SECRECY EXTENDS FROM THE PROCESSES OF 
CABINET GOVERNMENT TO SCHOOLS WHICH REFUSE TO RELEASE EXAM 
RESULTS. UNDER THE CITIZEN'S CHARTER. A GREAT DEAL MORE 
INFORMATION IS NOW BEING MADE AVAILABLE ON THE SERVICES 
PROVIDED BY GOVERNMENT.
   WE HAVE ALSO:
-REPLACED THE CATCH-ALL PROVISIONS OF THE 1911 OFFICIAL SECRETS 
ACT WITH NARROWER OFFENCES DEPENDING ON SPECIFIC TESTS OF THE 
HARM LIKELY TO BE CAUSED BY DISCLOSURE, WHILE GIVING SPECIAL 
PROTECTION TO VITAL INFORMATION RELATING TO OUR NATIONAL SECURITY; 
-INTRODUCED RIGHTS TO CHECK CERTAIN PERSONAL RECORDS HELD ON 
COMPUTER, AND SUPPORTED NEW RIGHTS OF ACCESS TO A RANGE OF 
GOVERNMENT RECORDS -COMMITTED OURSELVES TO A PUBLIC RIGHT OF 
ACCESS TO INFORMATION ABOUT THE ENVIRONMENT, INCLUDING WATER 
SUPPLY, AIR QUALITY, DUMPING AT SEA AND RADIOACTIVE SUBSTANCES; 
-MADE AVAILABLE MORE REPORTS ON MATTERS OF PUBLIC CONCERN 
SUCH AS FOOD SAFETY AND INDUSTRIAL RISKS. WE INTEND TO CARRY 
FORWARD THIS MOVE TOWARDS GREATER OPENNESS.
 WE WILL REVIEW THE 80 OR SO STATUTORY RESTRICTIONS WHICH EXIST 
ON THE DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION- RETAINING ONLY THOSE NEEDED 
TO PROTECT PRIVACY AND ESSENTIAL CONFIDENTIALITY
. WE WILL SEEK TO PROVIDE GREATER ACCESS TO PERSONAL RECORDS 
HELD BY GOVERNMENT.
 WE WILL BE LESS SECRETIVE ABOUT THE WORKINGS OF GOVERNMENT. 
FOR EXAMPLE, WHEN THE COMMITTEES OF THE CABINET ARE 
RECONSTITUTED AFTER THE ELECTION WE WILL, FOR THE FIRST TIME, SET OUT 
THEIR NAMES AND MEMBERSHIP. WE WILL UPDATE AND-FOR THE FIRST 
TIME-PUBLISH THE GUIDANCE FOR MINISTERS ON PROCEDURE.
 
THE WORKINGS OF PARLIAMENT

IT IS NOT JUST WHITEHALL THAT MUST CHANGE. PARLIAMENT, TOO, HAS TO 
KEEP ITS WORKING METHODS UNDER REVIEW TO MAKE SURE IT ATTRACTS 
THE BEST PEOPLE TO THE SERVICE OF THEIR COUNTRY AND USES THEIR 
TALENTS TO BEST EFFECT.
 WE WILL PROPOSE APPROPRIATE PARLIAMENTARY REFORMS TO ENSURE 
THAT THE HOUSE OF COMMONS CONDUCTS ITS BUSINESS MORE 
EFFICIENTLY AND EFFECTIVELY, TAKING INTO ACCOUNT THE BENEFIT OF 
MODERN TECHNOLOGY, THE INCREASING CONSTITUENCY DEMANDS UPON 
MEMBERS OF PARLIAMENT AND THE NEED TO ATTRACT MORE WOMEN TO 
STAND FOR ELECTION.
 
OPPORTUNITY FOR ALL

CONSERVATIVES BELIEVE THAT HIGH STANDARDS IN EDUCATION AND 
TRAINING ARE THE KEY TO PERSONAL OPPORTUNITY AND NATIONAL 
SUCCESS. WE BELIEVE IN PARTNERSHIP WITH PARENTS, CHOICE IN 
SCHOOLS AND A GOOD GROUNDING IN THE BASIC SKILLS ALL CHILDREN 
NEED TO MAKE A SUCCESS OF THEIR LIVES. WE ARE COMMITTED TO 
WIDENING OPPORTUNITIES WITHOUT COMPROMISING ACADEMIC 
STANDARDS. WE WILL CONTINUE TO EXPAND HIGHER EDUCATION AND 
TRAINING. WE WILL REINFORCE THE RIGHTS OF THE INDIVIDUAL IN THE 
WORLD OF WORK, AND BREAK DOWN ARTIFICIAL BARRIERS TO 
ADVANCEMENT. BY EXTENDING OPPORTUNITY AND ARMING PEOPLE 
WITH THE POWER TO CHOOSE, WE WILL GIVE VALUABLE FREEDOMS AND A 
POWERFUL SPUR TO ACHIEVEMENT.
 
SCHOOLS, PUPILS & PARENTS

WE ARE NOW SEEING REAL IMPROVEMENTS IN OUR EDUCATION SYSTEM. 
ONE IN FOUR YOUNG PEOPLE GOES ON TO HIGHER EDUCATION; AT THE 
BEGINNING OF THE 1980S, IT WAS ONLY ONE IN EIGHT. SIXTY PER CENT 
OF 16 YEAR-OLDS STAY ON IN FULL-TIME EDUCATION, UP FROM ONLY 40 
PER CENT IN 1979. AND WE HAVE EMBARKED ON THE MOST IMPORTANT 
AND WIDE-RANGING REFORMS SINCE THE 1940S. FOR THE FIRST TIME IN 
OUR HISTORY, WE WILL SOON HAVE A NATIONAL CURRICULUM WHICH WILL 
REQUIRE ALL THE MAIN SCHOOL SUBJECTS TO BE COVERED THOROUGHLY. 
THE TESTING OF SEVEN-YEAR-OLDS IS WELL UNDER WAY AND TESTS FOR 
OLDER CHILDREN ARE NOW BEING DEVELOPED. STARTING THIS 
SEPTEMBER, GCS E COURSES WILL BE STEADILY INTEGRATED WITH THE 
NATIONAL CURRICULUM.   
  UNDER THE PARENT'S CHARTER, ALL SCHOOLS WILL HAVE TO PROVIDE AT 
LEAST ONE WRITTEN REPORT ON THE PROGRESS OF EACH CHILD EACH YEAR. 
INFORMATION ON THE PERFORMANCE OF ALL LOCAL SCHOOLS WILL BE 
GIVEN TO PARENTS, ENABLING THEM TO EXERCISE CHOICE MORE 
EFFECTIVELY. WE BELIEVE ALL PARENTS HAVE THE RIGHT TO CHOICE IN 
EDUCATION-NOT ONLY THOSE WHO CAN AFFORD SCHOOL FEES. YOUNG 
PEOPLE DIFFER IN THEIR INTERESTS AND APTITUDES. AND WE NEED A 
RANGE OF SCHOOLS TO OFFER THEM THE BEST OPPORTUNITIES. WE HAVE 
ALWAYS FOUGHT TO MAINTAIN DIVERSITY IN EDUCATION. PROTECTING THE 
RIGHT OF LOCAL PEOPLE TO PRESERVE THEIR GRAMMAR SCHOOLS, AND 
DEFENDING INDEPENDENT SCHOOLS AGAINST MINDLESS LABOUR 
ATTACKS. AND WE HAVE ALWAYS VALUED THE IMPORTANT CONTRIBUTION 
MADE BY THE CHURCHES TO OUR CHILDREN'S EDUCATION.   
  WE HAVE FURTHER INCREASED DIVERSITY BY:
-GIVING SCHOOLS CONTROL OVER THEIR OWN BUDGETS AND 
ENCOURAGING NEW TYPES OF SCHOOL.
-ALLOWING SCHOOLS TO BECOME INDEPENDENT OF LOCAL COUNCILS, 
BY APPLYING FOR GRANT-MAINTAINED STATUS IF THE PARENTS INVOLVED 
SO WISH. BY MID- 1992, OVER 200 GM SCHOOLS WILL BE UP AND 
RUNNING.
 -CREATING A NUMBER OF HIGHLY POPULAR CITY TECHNOLOGY 
COLLEGES.
 -LAUNCHING THE HIGHLY SUCCESSFUL INITIATIVE UNDER WHICH 
SCHOOLS ARE ABLE TO BID DIRECTLY FOR THE RESOURCES TO BECOME 
TECHNOLOGY SCHOOLS. 
    WE INTEND TO TAKE ALL THESE INITIATIVES FARTHER AND OFFER 
PARENTS MORE CHOICE IN THE NEW PARLIAMENT. POPULAR SCHOOLS 
WILL BE ALLOWED TO EXPAND, AND MORE SCHOOLS WILL BE ABLE TO 
APPLY FOR TECHNOLOGY FUNDING. WE WILL MAKE IT EASIER FOR SMALL 
SCHOOLS TO ENJOY THE BENEFITS OF GM STATUS BY GROUPING 
TOGETHER.
 WE WILL COMPLETE THE INTRODUCTION OF THE NATIONAL CURRICULUM 
OFFERING 10 SUBJECTS AT A NATIONALLY DEFINED STANDARD-ENGLISH, 
MATHEMATICS, SCIENCE, HISTORY, GEOGRAPHY, TECHNOLOGY, ART, 
MUSIC, PE AND, IN SECONDARY SCHOOLS, A FOREIGN LANGUAGE.
 REGULAR AND STRAIGHTFORWARD TESTS WILL BE IN PLACE FOR ALL 
SEVEN, 11 AND 14-YEAR-OLDS BY 1994.
 GCS E AT AGE 16 WILL BE INTEGRATED INTO THE NATIONAL 
CURRICULUM, WITH A NEW A+ GRADE TO TEST THE MOST ABLE. THE 
MAJORITY OF MARKS WILL COME FROM A WRITTEN EXAM.
 WE WILL CONTINUE TO ENCOURAGE THE CREATION OF NURSERY PLACES. 
FOR THE FIRST TIME, OVER 50 PER CENT OF THREE AND FOUR-YEAR-OLDS 
HAVE PLACES EITHER IN NURSERY OR PRIMARY SCHOOLS. FULL 
INFORMATION WILL BE PUBLISHED ANNUALLY ABOUT THE PERFORMANCE 
OF ALL LOCAL SCHOOLS IN EACH AREA.
 INDEPENDENT INSPECTION OF SCHOOLS WILL PROVIDE PARENTS WITH 
STRAIGHTFORWARD REPORTS ON THEIR CHILD'S SCHOOL, TOGETHER WITH AN 
ACTION PLAN FROM GOVERNORS TO REMEDY ANY WEAKNESSES.
 POPULAR SCHOOLS WHICH ARE OVERSUBSCRIBED WILL BE GIVEN THE 
RESOURCES TO EXPAND.
 GM SCHOOLS WILL BE ABLE TO CHANGE THEIR CHARTER IF THAT IS 
WHAT PARENTS DEARLY WANT AND THE CHANGE FITS IN WITH THE WIDER 
NEEDS OF THE LOCAL AREA.
 THE TECHNOLOGY SCHOOLS INITIATIVE WILL BE EXPANDED ACROSS THE 
COUNTRY. 
 EXISTING SCHOOLS WHICH OPT FOR GM STATUS WILL BE ABLE TO 
EMULATE CITY TECHNOLOGY COLLEGES AND ATTRACT PRIVATE TECHNOLOGY 
SPONSORSHIP.
 WE WILL MAINTAIN THE ASSISTED PLACES SCHEME, WHICH GIVES 
ACCESS TO INDEPENDENT EDUCATION TO MANY FAMILIES WHO COULD 
NOT OTHERWISE AFFORD IT.
 WE WILL ENSURE THAT THE PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN THE STATE AND THE 
CHURCHES IN EDUCATION IS MAINTAINED AND STRENGTHENED.
 WE WILL ENABLE SMALL SCHOOLS TO APPLY FOR GM STATUS IN 
GROUPS.
 WE WILL PAY PARTICULAR ATTENTION TO RAISING EDUCATIONAL 
STANDARDS IN AREAS OF DEPRIVATION IN OUR CITIES.
 
TEACHING

WE ARE DETERMINED TO REINFORCE THE PROFESSIONALISM OF TEACHERS 
AND THE ESTEEM IN WHICH THEY ARE HELD. WE HAVE CREATED AN 
INDEPENDENT TEACHERS' PAY REVIEW BODY. WE ACCEPTED IN FULL ITS 
FIRST RECOMMENDATIONS; NEARLY HALF OF ALL TEACHERS ARE NOW 
EARNING OVER £20,000 A YEAR. WE WILL PRESS AHEAD WITH REGULAR 
APPRAISAL OF TEACHERS TO ENCOURAGE HIGH STANDARDS AND DEVELOP 
PROFESSIONAL 
    AS A FIRST STEP IN THE REFORM OF TEACHER TRAINING. POSTGRADUATE 
STUDENTS WILL SPEND MUCH MORE TIME IN SCHOOL CLASSROOMS, 
LEARNING THEIR SKILLS UNDER THE PRACTISED EYE OF SENIOR TEACHERS. 
IT IS VITAL THAT THE EDUCATION SYSTEM SHOULD ATTRACT BACK WOMEN 
WHO HAVE TAKEN A CAREER BREAK TO RAISE A FAMILY. THROUGH GRANTS 
TO LOCAL AUTHORITIES, WE ARE FINANCING SCHEMES TO INTRODUCE 
MORE FLEXIBLE WORKING PRACTICES-SUCH AS JOB-SHARING
 WE WILL UNDERTAKE REFORM OF THE TEACHER TRAINING SYSTEM TO 
MAKE IT MORE EFFECTIVE IN DEVELOPING CLASSROOM SKILLS.
 WE WILL DEVELOP MEASURES TO ENCOURAGE WOMEN WITH FAMILY 
RESPONSIBILITIES TO ENTER OR RETURN TO TEACHING.
 
AFTER 16

WE BELIEVE THAT YOUNG PEOPLE SHOULD BE FREE TO CHOOSE BETWEEN 
COLLEGE, WORK-BASED TRAINING AND SIXTH FORM STUDIES. WE ARE 
GIVING FURTHER EDUCATION COLLEGES AND SIXTH FORM COLLEGES IN 
ENGLAND AND WALES AUTONOMY, FREE FROM COUNCIL CONTROL. WE 
ALSO VALUE OUR SCHOOL SIXTH FORMS, AND WILL ENSURE THEY RETAIN 
THEIR PLACE IN THE NEW SYSTEM. AND WE WILL ALLOW THEM TO 
ATTRACT OLDER STUDENTS AS WELL. FE COLLEGES WILL CONTINUE TO 
RECEIVE SUPPORT FOR ADULT EDUCATION. WHILE LOCAL AUTHORITIES WILL 
RETAIN THE RESOURCES TO RESPOND TO LOCAL DEMAND FOR LEISURE 
COURSES.   
  WE WILL DEFEND THE WELL-RESPECTED A-LEVEL EXAMINATIONS. 
WHICH LABOUR WOULD DESTROY. WE WILL CONTINUE TO ENCOURAGE 
PARTICIPATION IN AS EXAMINATIONS. WE WILL ALSO CONTINUE TO 
DEVELOP NEW HIGH-QUALITY NATIONAL VOCATIONAL QUALIFICATIONS, 
AND INTRODUCE A NEW POST-16 DIPLOMA WHICH RECOGNISES 
ACHIEVEMENT IN BOTH VOCATIONAL AND ACADEMIC COURSES.
 WE WILL DEVELOP AN ADVANCED DIPLOMA WHICH CAN BE EARNED 
BY STUDENTS PURSUING EITHER ACADEMIC OR VOCATIONAL COURSES, AND 
A NEW GENERAL NATIONAL VOCATIONAL QUALIFICATION.
 WE INTEND TO ALLOW SCHOOL SIXTH FORMS TO OPEN THEIR DOORS IF 
THEY WISH TO OLDER STUDENTS, AND TO ACCEPT TRAINING CREDITS OR 
FEES FROM THEM.
 FROM APRIL NEXT YEAR, FURTHER EDUCATION AND SIXTH FORM 
COLLEGES WILL BE INDEPENDENT OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT CONTROL. 
MATURE STUDENTS WILL ENJOY A WIDER CHOICE OF COURSES. 

HIGHER EDUCATION

BRITAIN MAINTAINS THE BEST UNIVERSITY SYSTEM IN EUROPE. WE 
HAVE ALSO DEVELOPED A THRIVING NETWORK OF POLYTECHNICS, WHOSE 
STUDENT NUMBERS HAVE INCREASED NEARLY SIXFOLD SINCE THE END OF 
THE 1960S. BY THE YEAR 2000, ONE IN THREE YOUNG PEOPLE WILL 
FOLLOW FULL-TIME HIGHER EDUCATION COURSES. MEANWHILE, THE 
NUMBER OF MATURE ENTRANTS TO HIGHER EDUCATION HAS RISEN BY 65 
PER CENT SINCE 1979. AND OUR UNIVERSITIES ARE ATTRACTING 
INCREASING NUMBERS OF FOREIGN STUDENTS. DESPITE THIS HUGE 
EXPANSION, OUR STUDENTS ENJOY ONE OF THE MOST GENEROUS SUPPORT 
SYSTEMS IN THE WORLD. THE INTRODUCTION OF STUDENT LOANS HAS 
GIVEN STUDENTS 30 PER CENT MORE MONEY FOR THEIR LIVING COSTS 
THAN THE FORMER SYSTEM OF GRANTS ALONE. THE NEW SYSTEM WILL 
STEADILY REDUCE THE PROPORTION OF STUDENTS' LIVING COSTS THAT THEIR 
PARENTS ARE EXPECTED TO MEET.
 WE WILL CONTINUE TO EXPAND THE NUMBER OF STUDENTS IN HIGHER 
EDUCATION. WE ARE ABOLISHING THE ARTIFICIAL "BINARY LINE" 
BETWEEN UNIVERSITIES AND POLYTECHNICS.
 WE ARE PUTTING IN PLACE NEW MECHANISMS TO ENSURE THAT 
ACADEMIC STANDARDS ARE MAINTAINED IN HIGHER EDUCATION.
 WE WILL CONTINUE TO PROVIDE GENEROUS SUPPORT FOR STUDENTS 
AND TO EXPAND OUR STUDENT LOANS COMMITMENT. 

THE TRAINING REVOLUTION

A TRAINING REVOLUTION IS UNDERWAY IN BRITAIN. THE GOVERNMENT'S 
JOB IS TO CREATE A FRAMEWORK WITHIN WHICH MEN AND WOMEN OF 
ALL AGES CAN DEVELOP SKILLS, GAIN QUALIFICATIONS AND SHAPE THEIR 
OWN FUTURES.   
  WE HAVE ALREADY BROUGHT THE WORLD OF WORK AND THE WORLD OF 
SCHOOL INTO CLOSER HARMONY. GOVERNMENT AND INDUSTRY ARE 
WORKING TOGETHER. EMPLOYERS ALREADY SPEND OVER £20,000 
MILLION A YEAR ON TRAINING. GOVERNMENT SPENDING ON TRAINING 
HAS INCREASED 2.5 TIMES IN REAL TERMS SINCE 1979, TO £2,800 
MILLION. THE GOVERNMENT'S EFFORT IS BEING CHANNELLED THROUGH 
THE 82 NEW TRAINING AND ENTERPRISE COUNCILS (AND THE LOCAL 
ENTERPRISE COMPANIES IN SCOTLAND)
-THE MOST SIGNIFICANT PEACETIME PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN 
GOVERNMENT AND INDUSTRY THIS CENTURY.
 -'COMPACTS' HAVE RESULTED IN MANY YOUNG PEOPLE WORKING TO 
GOALS FOR ATTAINMENT AND ATTENDANCE IN SCHOOL. IN RETURN, THEY 
ARE GUARANTEED A JOB WITH TRAINING
-OR TRAINING LEADING TO A JOB.
 -THIS YEAR, TWO MILLION STUDENTS WILL PARTICIPATE IN THE 
TECHNICAL AND VOCATIONAL EDUCATION INITIATIVE.
 -INVESTORS IN PEOPLE IS THE NEW NATIONAL STANDARD FOR 
COMPANIES MAKING A COMMITMENT TO TRAINING. TECS PLAY AN 
IMPORTANT ROLE IN HELPING COMPANIES ATTAIN IT.
 -EMPLOYER-LED TECS AND LECS ARE DELIVERING GOVERNMENT-
FUNDED TRAINING PROGRAMMES WHICH REFLECT INDUSTRY'S 
UNDERSTANDING OF LOCAL NEEDS.
 -INDUSTRY IS WORKING CLOSELY WITH THE NATIONAL COUNCIL FOR 
VOCATIONAL QUALIFICATIONS.
-THE CBI'S TRAINING TARGETS FOR BRITAIN'S WORKFORCE 
DEMONSTRATE A NEW PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN BUSINESS AND 
EDUCATION.  
   SEVENTY-FIVE PER CENT OF 1 6-YEAR-OLDS STAY ON IN FULL-TIME 
EDUCATION OR YOUTH TRAINING SCHEMES, UP FROM 46 PER CENT IN 
1979. SINCE 1983, OVER THREE MILLION YOUNG PEOPLE HAVE TAKEN 
UP YOUTH TRAINING PLACES. AND 82 PER CENT GO INTO JOBS OR 
FURTHER EDUCATION WHEN THEY COMPLETE YT. NOW WE ARE 
OFFERING YOUNG PEOPLE AGED 16 AND 17 VOUCHERS THEY CAN USE TO 
BUY APPROVED COURSES OF EDUCATION OR TRAINING, AND WHICH WILL 
PUT THE POWER OF CHOICE IN THEIR HANDS. 
    IN 1988 WE LAUNCHED EMPLOYMENT TRAINING. THE LARGEST 
PROGRAMME OF ITS KIND IN EUROPE. WHICH HAS SINCE HELPED 1.2 
MILLION PEOPLE. WHILE LOCAL PROGRAMMES ARE THE RESPONSIBILITY 
OF THE TECS, THE GOVERNMENT GUARANTEES THE OFFER OF HELP TO 
PARTICULAR GROUPS OF UNEMPLOYED. LAST YEAR. WE LAUNCHED THE 
NEW EMPLOYMENT ACTION PROGRAMME, WHICH WILL HELP MORE THAN 
61,000 PEOPLE IN A FULL YEAR. THIS IS A NEW ADDITION TO A RANGE 
OF MEASURES WHICH INCLUDE JOBCLUBS, THE JOB INTERVIEW 
GUARANTEE SCHEME AND OTHER TESTED METHODS OF HELPING 
UNEMPLOYED PEOPLE BACK TO WORK. 
    WE ARE ALSO SUPPORTING INDIVIDUAL TRAINING EFFORT. SINCE 
1988, WHEN WE LAUNCHED CAREER DEVELOPMENT LOANS (INTEREST-
FREE FOR UP TO 15 MONTHS). OVER 25,000 PEOPLE HAVE BENEFITED. 
LAST YEAR'S BUDGET GAVE TAX RELIEF ON TRAINING FEES
-A BOOST TO THE 250,000 PEOPLE A YEAR WHO FINANCE THEIR OWN 
TRAINING. NOW, WITH THE TECS, WE INTEND TO INTRODUCE NEW 
FINANCIAL HELP FOR CAREER AND TRAINING GUIDANCE.
 BY THE END OF THE NEW PARLIAMENT, THE NEW SYSTEM OF NATIONAL 
VOCATIONAL QUALIFICATIONS SHOULD COVER VIRTUALLY EVERY 
OCCUPATION IN THE ECONOMY. THE CBI'S TRAINING TARGETS ENVISAGE 
80 PER CENT OF YOUNG PEOPLE REACHING NVQ LEVEL 2 BY THE END 
OF THE PARLIAMENT.
 WE INTEND TO MAKE TRAINING CREDITS AVAILABLE TO ALL 16-YEAR-
OLDS AND 17-YEAR-OLDS WITHIN THE LIFETIME OF THE NEW 
PARLIAMENT. THE TECS WILL CONTINUE TO BE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE 
YT PROGRAMME FOR THIS AGE GROUP.
 WE WILL CONTINUE TO FINANCE TRAINING PROGRAMMES FOR THE 
LONG-TERM UNEMPLOYED AND THOSE WHO FACE PARTICULAR 
DIFFICULTIES.
 WE WILL LAUNCH WITH THE TECS A NEW INITIATIVE, GIVING PEOPLE 
A VOUCHER WITH WHICH THEY CAN BUY A 'SKILL CHECK', PROVIDING 
ASSESSMENT AND GUIDANCE ON HOW TO MAKE THE MOST OF THEIR 
WORKING LIVES.
 
 WORKERS AND UNIONS

OVER THE PAST 13 YEARS, WE HAVE LEGISLATED TO LIFT REGULATORY 
BURDENS FROM THE SHOULDERS OF THOSE WHO CREATE JOBS IN BRITAIN. 
TO INDUSTRY'S RELIEF, WE SHUNNED THE JOB-DESTROYING EUROPEAN 
SOCIAL CHARTER. AND WE REJECT LABOUR'S JOB-DESTROYING NOTION OF 
A NATIONAL MINIMUM WAGE. WE HAVE ALSO LEGISLATED FIVE TIMES 
TO TRANSFORM INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS, RETURNING POWER FROM MILITANTS 
TO ORDINARY UNION MEMBERS. AS A RESULT, THE NUMBER OF DAYS LOST 
EACH YEAR THROUGH STRIKES HAS FALLEN FROM AN AVERAGE 12.9 
MILLION IN THE 1970S TO LESS THAN A MILLION LAST YEAR
-THE LOWEST FIGURE SINCE RECORDS BEGAN A CENTURY AGO.   
  LABOUR WOULD DISRUPT INDUSTRIAL PEACE BY WEAKENING THE 
POWER OF MANAGEMENT AND THE COURTS. THEY PROPOSE TO TAKE 
AWAY THE COURTS' MOST IMPORTANT SANCTION
-THE POWER TO TAKE OVER A UNION'S ASSETS. SYMPATHY STRIKES 
WOULD BE LEGALISED BY LABOUR, AND EMPLOYERS WOULD BE 
PREVENTED FROM DISMISSING STRIKERS WHO BROKE THEIR CONTRACTS.  
   THE WORKERS' RIGHTS WE BELIEVE IN ARE THOSE WHICH ENHANCE AN 
INDIVIDUAL'S STATUS AND OPPORTUNITIES. WE BELIEVE PEOPLE SHOULD 
BE INFORMED AND CONSULTED BY EMPLOYERS ABOUT ISSUES WHICH 
AFFECT THEIR WORK. NO ONE SHOULD BE ALLOWED TO DEDUCT TRADE 
UNION FEES AUTOMATICALLY FROM AN EMPLOYEE'S PAY WITHOUT 
WRITTEN AUTHORISATION. INDIVIDUALS MUST BE GIVEN GREATER RIGHTS 
TO BELONG TO THE UNION OF THEIR CHOICE. WE ALSO BELIEVE STRONGLY 
THAT EMPLOYERS, EMPLOYEES AND CUSTOMERS SHOULD NOT HAVE THEIR 
LIVES AND BUSINESSES DISRUPTED BY WILDCAT STRIKES. IN THE NEW 
PARLIAMENT, WE WILL LEGISLATE TO ENFORCE AND ENHANCE THESE 
RIGHTS.
 WE WILL REQUIRE EMPLOYERS TO GIVE EVERYONE WHO WORKS FOR 
THEM FOR MORE THAN EIGHT HOURS A WEEK A CLEAR WRITTEN STATEMENT 
OF THEIR TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF EMPLOYMENT.
 WE WILL MAKE AUTOMATIC DEDUCTION OF UNION MEMBERSHIP 
DUES WITHOUT WRITTEN AUTHORISATION UNLAWFUL.
 WE WILL TAKE MEASURES TO GIVE INDIVIDUAL GREATER FREEDOM IN 
CHOOSING A UNION. 
 WE WILL LEGISLATE TO REQUIRE THAT ALL PRE-STRIKE BALLOTS ARE 
POSTAL AND SUBJECT TO INDEPENDENT SCRUTINY, AND THAT AT LEAST 
SEVEN DAYS' NOTICE OF A STRIKE IS GIVEN AFTER A BALLOT.
 PEOPLE WHO USE PUBLIC SERVICES WILL HAVE THE RIGHT TO RESTRAIN 
THE DISRUPTION OF THOSE SERVICES BY UNLAWFUL INDUSTRIAL ACTION.
 
 A SHARE IN THE FUTURE

WE ALSO BELIEVE THAT PEOPLE AT WORK SHOULD BE HELPED TO BUILD 
SECURITY FOR THEMSELVES AND THEIR FAMILIES. EMPLOYEES SHOULD 
BE GIVEN EVERY OPPORTUNITY TO ACQUIRE A STAKE IN THE BUSINESS 
FOR WHICH THEY WORK. WE HAVE RULED THAT EXECUTIVE SHARE OPTION 
SCHEMES MAY GRANT OPTIONS AT A DISCOUNT ONLY IF THE EMPLOYER 
ALSO RUNS AN ALL-EMPLOYEE SCHEME.     SAVING FOR A PENSION 
REDUCES RELIANCE ON THE STATE. WE WELCOME THE PROVISION OF 
OCCUPATIONAL SCHEMES COVERING OVER 11 MILLION WORKERS. THERE 
ARE ALREADY IMPORTANT SAFEGUARDS, WHICH WE HAVE IMPROVED, FOR 
THE RIGHTS OF MEMBERS IN SUCH SCHEMES. BUT WE BELIEVE THAT A 
FULL REVIEW OF THE ARRANGEMENTS IS NOW NEEDED. WE ALSO BELIEVE 
THE NEW FREEDOMS FOR SCHEME MEMBERS WILL STRENGTHEN 
ACCOUNTABILITY AND BENEFIT INVESTORS. WE WILL ESTABLISH A 
REVIEW OF THE FRAMEWORK OF LAW AND REGULATION WITHIN WHICH 
OCCUPATIONAL SCHEMES OPERATE.
 WE WILL GIVE EVERY MEMBER OF AN OCCUPATIONAL SCHEME THE 
RIGHT TO AN ANNUAL STATEMENT OF THE VALUE OF THEIR SAVINGS.
 IN ADDITION WE WILL EXAMINE WAYS OF GIVING THOSE WHO RETIRE 
WITH LUMP SUM PAYMENTS MORE CHOICE AS TO HOW THEIR SAVINGS 
ARE INVESTED.
 
 WOMEN AND OPPORTUNITY

A HIGHER PROPORTION OF WOMEN GO OUT TO WORK IN BRITAIN THAN IN 
ANY OTHER EC COUNTRY EXCEPT DENMARK. MANY WOMEN CHOOSE TO 
WORK PART-TIME, AND OUR POLICIES HAVE ENCOURAGED THE 
DEVELOPMENT OF PART-TIME WORK WITHIN A FRAMEWORK WHICH 
SAFEGUARDS EMPLOYEES FROM EXPLOITATION.

    THROUGHOUT EUROPE, THE UK IS RECOGNISED TO HAVE THE MOST 
COMPREHENSIVE LEGISLATION TO COMBAT SEX DISCRIMINATION. WE 
ARE ALSO COMMITTED TO BREAKING DOWN ARTIFICIAL BARRIERS TO 
WOMEN'S ADVANCEMENT BASED ON PREJUDICE OR LACK OF 
IMAGINATION. AS AN EMPLOYER. GOVERNMENT MUST CONTINUE TO SET 
AN EXAMPLE.  
   THE TAX RELIEF WE HAVE INTRODUCED ON TRAINING FEES IS 
CONSTRUCTED TO ENSURE THAT NON-TAX PAYERS 
-WHO INCLUDE MANY MARRIED WOMEN
-WILL BE ABLE TO BENEFIT, TOO. MANY TRAINING AND ENTERPRISE 
COUNCILS ALREADY HAVE SPECIFIC PLANS TO HELP WOMEN TRAINEES. 
WE WILL INVOLVE THEM FURTHER IN HELPING EMPLOYERS TO HELP WITH 
CHILDCARE.   
  WE BELIEVE MOTHERS SHOULD BE TREATED EQUALLY BY GOVERNMENT, 
WHETHER THEY WORK OUTSIDE THE HOME OR NOT. WE ARE FULLY 
COMMITTED TO MAINTAINING THE REAL VALUE OF CHILD BENEFIT. AND 
WE WILL ACT WHERE A PUSH BY GOVERNMENT IS NEEDED TO STIMULATE 
THE PROVISION OF CHILDCARE.   
  ALL EMPLOYERS WHO MEET CHILDCARE COSTS CAN SET THESE OFF 
AGAINST THEIR LIABILITY FOR CORPORATION TAX. IN ADDITION, WE HAVE 
RELIEVED EMPLOYEES FROM PAYING INCOME TAX ON THE BENEFIT OF 
WORKPLACE NURSERIES.   
  AFTER-SCHOOL CHILDCARE IS AN AREA OF PARTICULAR IMPORTANCE TO 
MANY WORKING MOTHERS. WE WILL INTRODUCE A NEW INITIATIVE TO 
ENCOURAGE THE PROVISION OF AFTER-SCHOOL FACILITIES BY SCHOOLS, 
EMPLOYERS AND VOLUNTARY GROUPS ACROSS THE COUNTRY.
 THE GOVERNMENT WILL AMEND THE LAW RELATING TO THE 
EMPLOYMENT RIGHTS OF PREGNANT WOMEN TO GIVE EFFECT TO THE EC 
DIRECTIVE ON PREGNANT WORKERS. THIS ADDITION TO OUR ALREADY 
EXTENSIVE LEGAL PROVISION WILL GIVE A RIGHT TO AT LEAST 14 WEEKS' 
MATERNITY LEAVE AND PROTECTION AGAINST DISMISSAL ON GROUNDS OF 
PREGNANCY.
 WE WILL TAKE FORWARD OUR PUBLIC APPOINTMENTS INITIATIVE. 
DEPARTMENTS WILL PUBLISH PLANS FOR BETWEEN A QUARTER AND A HALF 
OF PUBLIC APPOINTMENTS TO BE HELD BY WOMEN BY 1996.
 WE WILL ENSURE THAT ALL PARTS OF GOVERNMENT ADOPT A STRATEGIC 
APPROACH TO THE EMPLOYMENT AND DEVELOPMENT OF WOMEN STAFF. 
WE WILL ENCOURAGE THEM TO PARTICIPATE IN THE OPPORTUNITY 2000 
INITIATIVE.
 WE WILL CONTINUE TO OPPOSE EC MEASURES WHICH WOULD 
DISCOURAGE PART-TIME EMPLOYMENT, VALUED BY SO MANY WOMEN.
 WE WILL ENCOURAGE ALL TECS TO ADOPT PLANS TO HELP WOMEN 
TRAINEES HAVE EQUAL ACCESS TO TRAINING OPPORTUNITIES.
 WE WILL INTRODUCE A NEW GRANT, PAID THROUGH TECS, TO HELP 
EMPLOYERS, VOLUNTARY GROUPS OR SCHOOLS TO SET UP AFTER-SCHOOL 
CARE AND HOLIDAY ARRANGEMENTS. WE WILL ENSURE THAT SCHOOLS ARE 
FREE TO PARTICIPATE.
 
FREEDOM UNDER THE LAW

THE CONSERVATIVE PARTY HAS ALWAYS STOOD FOR THE PROTECTION OF 
THE CITIZEN AND THE DEFENCE OF THE RULE OF LAW. SOCIETY IS ENTITLED 
TO A SENSE OF SECURITY; INDIVIDUALS TO PEACE OF MIND; THE 
GUARDIANS OF THAT PEACE TO OUR WHOLE-HEARTED SUPPORT. OUR 
POLICIES ON LAW AND ORDER, AND THE RIGHTS OF INDIVIDUALS. ARE 
DESIGNED TO PROTECT THE PEOPLE OF THIS COUNTRY AND THEIR WAY OF 
LIFE.   
  BRITAIN EXPERIENCES LESS VIOLENT CRIME THAN MANY COMPARABLE 
COUNTRIES. BUT CRIME HAS CONTINUED TO RISE IN BRITAIN. AND THE 
CHALLENGE FOR THE 1990S IS TO STEP UP THE FIGHT AGAINST 
LAWLESSNESS AND VIOLENCE, SO THAT OUR CITIZENS CAN LIVE FREE FROM 
FEAR. 
    WE MUST CONTINUE TO ENSURE THAT THE SENTENCE FITS THE CRIME
-WITH LONG SENTENCES FOR DANGEROUS CRIMINALS, AND FINES AND A 
TOUGHER REGIME FOR PUNISHMENT OUTSIDE PRISON AVAILABLE AS AN 
ALTERNATIVE FOR LESS SERIOUS CRIME. AND WE MUST MAINTAIN 
CONFIDENCE IN OUR LEGAL SYSTEM.  
   WE MUST TACKLE CRIME AT ITS ROOTS. TWO-THIRDS OF THE OFFENCES 
DEALT WITH BY OUR COURTS ARE COMMITTED BY ONLY 7 PER CENT OF 
THOSE CONVICTED. MOST OF THESE CONSTANT OFFENDERS STARTED DOWN 
THE PATH OF CRIME WHILE STILL OF SCHOOL AGE.    
 WE HAVE LAUNCHED A REFORM OF OUR PRISONS, IMPROVING THE 
PROSPECT THAT THOSE WHO SERVE CUSTODIAL SENTENCES WILL NOT 
RETURN TO CRIME.  
   BUT ABOVE ALL, WE MUST REMEMBER THAT IT IS OUR POLICEMEN AND 
WOMEN WHO ARE IN THE FRONT LINE OF THE BATTLE. TO COMBAT CRIME 
EFFECTIVELY, THE POLICE NEED THE FULL SUPPORT OF THE GOVERNMENT 
AND THE PUBLIC.
 
POLICE AND THE COMMUNITY

WE CONSERVATIVES CAN BE PROUD OF OUR RECORD IN SUPPORTING THE 
POLICE. SINCE 1979 WE HAVE INCREASED SPENDING ON THE POLICE BY 
74 PER CENT IN REAL TERMS. UNIFORMED MANPOWER HAS INCREASED 
BY 16,000 AND CIVILIAN MANPOWER BY 12,000. WE HAVE 
LAUNCHED A CAMPAIGN TO RECRUIT 10,000 SPECIAL CONSTABLES. 
    OVER THE NEXT FEW YEARS WE WANT TO SEE A MAJOR REFORM 
WHICH WILL HELP PROVIDE WHAT THE PUBLIC WANTS AND NEEDS: A 
VISIBLE, LOCAL POLICE PRESENCE. 
    WE WILL BE ENCOURAGING POLICE FORCES TO DEVELOP LOCAL 
COMMUNITY POLICING, TO LINK THE FORCE MORE CLOSELY WITH THE 
COMMUNITIES THEY PROTECT. THE METROPOLITAN POLICE WILL BE 
REORGANISED ON THIS BASIS BY THE SPRING OF 1993. TWO-THIRDS OF 
ENGLISH AND WELSH FORCES ARE ALREADY PREPARING SIMILAR PLANS. 
PILOT SCHEMES SUGGEST THEY CAN ADD GREATLY TO THE CITIZEN'S SENSE 
OF SECURITY AND BUILD SUPPORT FOR THE POLICE. 
    COMMUNITY POLICING WILL INVOLVE LOCAL RESIDENTS, LISTEN TO 
THEIR VIEWS AND ENGAGE THEIR HELP IN THE FIGHT AGAINST CRIME. IT 
WILL MEAN: 
-SMALLER POLICE UNITS WITH OFFICERS SERVING THE SAME AREA FOR 
LONGER. THAT WAY, PEOPLE CAN REALLY GET TO KNOW THEIR LOCAL 
POLICE OFFICERS; 
-EACH POLICE FORCE DEVOLVING ITS MANAGEMENT AND OPERATIONAL 
CONTROL TO LOCAL UNITS, AND STREAMLINING ITS CHAIN OF COMMAND 
-GETTING POLICE BACK ON THE BEAT, AND IN CLOSE CONTACT WITH THE 
NEIGHBOURHOODS UNDER THEIR CARE.
    IT WILL BE SUPPORTED BY AN EXTENSION OF NEIGHBOURHOOD WATCH 
SCHEMES, WHICH ARE VITAL IN DETERRING THEFT AND BURGLARIES.   
  PUBLIC CONFIDENCE IN THE POLICE IS ENHANCED WHEN PEOPLE 
KNOW WHAT THEY CAN EXPECT FROM THEIR LOCAL POLICE FORCE, AND 
WHEN OUTSIDERS ARE LET INTO THE PROCESS OF INSPECTING HOW THEY 
WORK. AT LEAST FIVE POLICE FORCES ARE ALREADY LEADING THE WAY 
WITH CHARTERS SETTING OUT THEIR TARGETS.
 WE ARE CONTINUING TO INCREASE POLICE NUMBERS. THERE WILL BE 
1,000 EXTRA POLICE OFFICERS THIS YEAR.
 WE WILL CONTINUE TO GIVE THE POLICE THE SUPPORT AND RESOURCES 
THEY NEED TO CARRY OUT THEIR DUTIES EFFECTIVELY AND EFFICIENTLY.
 WE WILL BE SEEKING THE NATION-WIDE INTRODUCTION OF 
COMMUNITY POLICING.
 WE WILL ENCOURAGE CIVILIANISATION AS A MEANS OF FREEING 
POLICE OFFICERS FOR OPERATIONAL DUTIES.
 WE WILL ENCOURAGE THE EXTENSION OF NEIGHBOURHOOD WATCH TO 
MORE RESIDENTIAL AREAS.
 WE WILL CONTINUE TO INCREASE THE SPECIAL CONSTABULARY, WHICH 
HAS SEEN A RISE IN RECRUITMENT THIS YEAR OF TEN PER CENT.
 WE WANT EACH POLICE FORCE TO PRODUCE A CHARTER TELLING LOCAL 
PEOPLE, FOR EXAMPLE, HOW QUICKLY THE POLICE WILL AIM TO 
RESPOND TO EMERGENCY CALLS.
 WE WILL INTRODUCE LAY INSPECTORS WITH MANAGEMENT 
EXPERIENCE INTO THE POLICE INSPECTORATE.
 
PROTECTORS AND VICTIMS

WE LOOK TO THE POLICE TO PROTECT US. THEY RISK THEIR LIVES TO DO 
SO. POLICE OFFICERS ARE ENTITLED TO THE PROTECTION OF THE 
COMMUNITY THEY SERVE. THOSE WHO INDULGE IN THE SHAMEFUL 
PRACTICE OF 'AMBUSHING', OR SEEKING TO FRUSTRATE THE WORK OF THE 
EMERGENCY SERVICES, DESERVE TO FACE SEVERE PENALTIES. WE 
WELCOME THE FINDINGS OF A STUDY BY THE HOME OFFICE AND 
CROWN PROSECUTION SERVICE WHICH SHOWS THAT ASSAULTS ON 
POLICEMEN ATTRACT CONSISTENTLY HEAVIER PENALTIES. BUT WE WILL 
EXAMINE WAYS OF INTRODUCING FURTHER PROTECTION FOR THE POLICE.  
   WE MUST ALSO PAY SPECIAL ATTENTION TO THE NEEDS OF THE VICTIMS 
OF CRIME, IN THE COURTS AND IN REBUILDING THEIR LIVES . WE HAVE 
INCREASED FUNDING FOR VICTIM SUPPORT. THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE 
DIRECTLY AFFECTED BY VIOLENT AND SEXUAL CRIME REMAINS RELATIVELY 
SMALL. BUT FEAR OF CRIME CAN HAVE A DEVASTATING EFFECT ON 
PEOPLE'S LIVES, AND PARTICULARLY ON WOMEN'S LIVES. WE ARE 
DETERMINED TO REDUCE THIS FEAR.
 WE WILL SET UP A WORKING PARTY TO EXAMINE WHAT MORE CAN BE 
DONE TO PROTECT THE POLICE AND MEMBERS OF OTHER EMERGENCY 
SERVICES FROM ASSAULT.
 WE WILL ENCOURAGE VICTIMS TO REPORT SEXUAL OFFENCES BY 
GIVING THEM STATUTORY ANONYMITY. UNDER OUR SAFER CITIES 
PROGRAMME, THERE ARE 124 SCHEMES TO IMPROVE STREET LIGHTING, 
WHICH HAS BEEN SHOWN TO REDUCE THE FEAR OF CRIME SIGNIFICANTLY.
 WOMEN-ONLY TAXI SERVICES ARE BEING ENCOURAGED UNDER THE 
SAME SAFER CITIES PROGRAMME. 

PENALTIES AND PREVENTION

OUR ARMOURY OF CRIMINAL LAW AND PENALTIES REQUIRES CONSTANT 
REVIEW. WE HAVE JUST INTRODUCED A NEW LAW SPECIFICALLY AIMED 
AT THE SO-CALLED JOY-RIDER. THIS PLACES THE RESPONSIBILITY FOR 
DANGEROUS DRIVING, DAMAGE, INJURY OR DEATH FOLLOWING FROM THE 
TAKING OF A VEHICLE SQUARELY ON THE SHOULDERS OF THOSE IN IT. 
EVEN WHERE JOY-RIDING IS NOT INVOLVED, CAUSING DEATH THROUGH 
DANGEROUS OR DRINK DRIVING IS A VERY SERIOUS OFFENCE. WE 
BELIEVE THAT THE MAXIMUM SENTENCE FOR SUCH A CRIME SHOULD 
REFLECT ITS GRAVITY. 
    SQUATTING IS NOTHING LESS THAN THE SEIZURE OF ANOTHER'S 
PROPERTY WITHOUT CONSENT. HAVING CONSULTED WIDELY ON THE 
SUBJECT, WE HAVE DECIDED TO EXTEND THE CRIMINAL LAW DEALING 
WITH SQUATTING. ILLEGAL CAMPING BY GYPSIES OR OTHER TRAVELLERS 
CAN AFFECT THE LIVES OF WHOLE COMMUNITIES. WE BELIEVE THAT THIS 
PROBLEM MUST BE TACKLED.   
  WE ARE CONCERNED ABOUT THE SMALL BUT PERSISTENT MINORITY, 
PARTICULARLY OF YOUNG PEOPLE, WHO RE-OFFEND WHILE ALREADY ON 
BAIL. WE HAVE ANNOUNCED NEW MEASURES TO DETER THEM FROM 
REPEATED CRIME. YOUNG PEOPLE WHO FIND THEMSELVES ON 
PROBATION FOR SHOP-LIFTING, VANDALISM OR PETTY THUGGERY SHOULD 
BE SHOWN WHERE THE PATH OF CRIME MAY LEAD. THEY SHOULD BE 
GIVEN A BRIEF PERSONAL EXPERIENCE OF THE NATURE OF PRISON LIFE.
 JOY-RIDERS WILL NOW FACE PRISON SENTENCES OF UP TO FIVE YEARS, 
UNLIMITED FINES AND UNLIMITED DRIVING BANS.
 WE WILL EXTEND THE MAXIMUM SENTENCE FOR CAUSING DEATH 
THROUGH DANGEROUS OR DRINK DRIVING.
 WE WILL CREATE A NEW CRIMINAL OFFENCE OF SQUATTING, TO GIVE 
GREATER PROTECTION TO THE OWNERS AND OCCUPANTS OF SHOPS, 
COMMERCIAL PREMISES, HOUSES AND FLATS.
 THE 1968 CARAVAN SITES ACT WILL BE REVIEWED WITH THE AIM OF 
REDUCING THE NUISANCE OF ILLEGAL ENCAMPMENTS.

 AS PART OF A COMMUNITY SENTENCE, YOUNG OFFENDERS WILL BE 
TAKEN TO SEE WHAT LIFE IS REALLY LIKE INSIDE ONE OF OUR PRISONS-A 
SOBERING EXPERIENCE FOR THEM.
 WE WILL INTRODUCE A NEW POLICE POWER TO MAKE AN ARREST FOR 
BREACH OF POLICE BAIL.
 WE WILL GIVE THE COURTS THE STATUTORY POWER TO INCREASE 
SENTENCES FOR THOSE WHO OFFEND WHILE ON BAIL.
 WE WILL INCREASE THE NUMBER OF BAIL HOSTEL PLACES, TO ENABLE 
CLOSER SUPERVISION OF THOSE ON BAIL.
 WE WILL MOUNT A DRIVE AGAINST SCHOOL TRUANCY, AND SET UP A 
TASK FORCE TO FIND THE BEST WAYS OF CO-ORDINATING THE WORK OF 
LOCAL AGENCIES HELPING YOUNG PEOPLE AT RISK OF BECOMING 
OFFENDERS.
 
    REFORMING OUR PRISONS

PRISONS SHOULD BE PLACES WHICH ARE AUSTERE BUT DECENT, 
PROVIDING A BUSY AND POSITIVE REGIME WHICH PREPARES PRISONERS 
FOR THEIR ULTIMATE RELEASE. WE HAVE BEEN REVERSING THE LABOUR 
PARTY'S NEGLECT OF THE PRISON SERVICE IN THE 1970S. SINCE 1985, 
14 NEW PRISONS HAVE BEEN OPENED. SEVEN MORE WILL OPEN OVER 
THE NEXT TWO YEARS. THE END OF OVERCROWDING IS NOW IN SIGHT.   
  WE HAVE ALREADY TAKEN STEPS TO IMPLEMENT THE KEY 
RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE WOOLF REPORT ON THE FUTURE OF OUR 
PRISONS. WE WILL BRING PRIVATE SECTOR SKILLS IN TO ENHANCE 
EFFICIENCY AND INCREASE VALUE FOR MONEY. WE HAVE PUT OUT TO 
TENDER THE CONTRACT FOR PRISON ESCORT SERVICES, AN APPROACH 
WHICH HAS WORKED WELL IN OTHER COUNTRIES. THE FIRST CONTRACT FOR 
A PRIVATELY MANAGED REMAND CENTRE HAS BEEN AWARDED.
 WE WILL SUSTAIN OUR MASSIVE PRISON REFORM AND BUILDING 
PROGRAMME.
 A RECONSTRUCTION PROGRAMME WILL END THE DEGRADING NEED FOR 
"SLOPPING OUT" BY THE END OF 1994 .
 WE WILL REORGANISE PRISONERS' EDUCATION, TRAINING AND WORK 
OPPORTUNITIES.
 WE WILL ESTABLISH THE PRISON SERVICE AS A SEPARATE AGENCY, 
WHOSE DIRECTOR WILL HAVE THE CLEAR RESPONSIBILITY FOR DAY-TO-DAY 
OPERATIONS. THE HOME SECRETARY WILL REMAIN MINISTERIALLY 
ACCOUNTABLE TO PARLIAMENT FOR PRISON POLICY.
 WE WILL INCREASE THE USE OF PRIVATE SECTOR MANAGEMENT SKILLS.
 
    OUR LEGAL SYSTEM

AS A FREE SOCIETY WE MUST HAVE A JUSTICE SYSTEM THAT IS FAIR, 
ACCESSIBLE AND RESPONSIVE TO THE CITIZEN. WE HAVE INTRODUCED 
NEW POWERS FOR THE COURT OF APPEAL TO INCREASE SENTENCES FOR 
CRIME. AND IN RESPONSE TO PUBLIC CONCERN ABOUT A SMALL BUT 
SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF MISCARRIAGES OF JUSTICE, WE HAVE 
APPOINTED A ROYAL COMMISSION TO REVIEW ASPECTS OF THE CRIMINAL 
JUSTICE SYSTEM, INCLUDING THE CONDUCT OF INVESTIGATIONS, THE 
HANDLING OF FORENSIC EVIDENCE, AND THE POWERS OF THE COURT OF 
APPEAL.  
   WE HAVE ALREADY REDUCED THE OPPORTUNITY FOR ABUSE BY OUR 
INTRODUCTION OF TAPE-RECORDED INTERVIEWS OF SUSPECTS BY THE 
POLICE. AT THE SAME TIME, WE ARE CONCERNED THAT POLICE 
INVESTIGATIONS SHOULD NOT BE MADE MORE DIFFICULT BY THE MISUSE 
OF CERTAIN RIGHTS. WE HAVE ALREADY INTRODUCED A WIDE RANGE OF 
REFORMS FOLLOWING OUR CIVIL JUSTICE REVIEW. EXTENDING THE 
JURISDICTION OF THE COUNTY COURTS HAS HELPED SPEED UP JUSTICE. 
THE SUCCESS OF THE SMALL CLAIMS SYSTEM IN THESE COURTS HAS 
SHOWN THAT SIMPLIFIED PROCEDURES CAN ENABLE PEOPLE TO CONDUCT 
THEIR OWN CASES OR RELY ON A LAY ADVISER. WE HAVE ALSO 
INTRODUCED A REFORM WHICH WILL GIVE PEOPLE MORE CHOICE AS TO 
WHO REPRESENTS THEM LEGALLY IN COURT.  
   WE ARE COMMITTED TO ENABLING PEOPLE WITH LIMITED MEANS TO 
HAVE ACCESS TO LEGAL SERVICES. WE ARE DETERMINED TO ENSURE THAT 
THESE SERVICES ARE DELIVERED EFFICIENTLY, IN A WAY WHICH 
PROVIDES THE BEST VALUE FOR MONEY. THE PRINCIPLES OF THE 
CITIZEN'S CHARTER ARE BEING APPLIED TO OUR LEGAL SYSTEM. WE WILL 
SHORTLY BE PUBLISHING A COURTS CHARTER. WE ARE OVERHAULING THE 
WAY IN WHICH FAMILY MATTERS ARE HANDLED IN OUR COURTS. THE 
NEW FAMILY CODE WILL BE APPLIED BY MAGISTRATES AND JUDGES 
ESPECIALLY TRAINED IN FAMILY LAW.     OUR SUNDAY TRADING LAWS 
HAVE COME INTO QUESTION AS A RESULT OF A POSSIBLE CONFLICT WITH 
ARTICLE 30 OF THE TREATY OF ROME. THIS MATTER IS NOW BEFORE THE 
EUROPEAN COURT OF JUSTICE, AND WE ARE AWAITING A JUDGEMENT. 
THE GOVERNMENT BROUGHT FORWARD PROPOSALS IN 1986 TO REFORM 
THE SHOPPING LAWS, BUT PARLIAMENT WAS NOT ABLE TO AGREE A 
CONCLUSION. PARLIAMENT WILL BE GIVEN THE OPPORTUNITY TO 
CONSIDER THIS ISSUE AGAIN. 
 WE WILL INTRODUCE A MAJOR CRIMINAL JUSTICE BILL IN THE LIFETIME 
OF THE NEW PARLIAMENT.
 WE WILL EXTEND THE TYPES OF CASES WHICH CAN BE HANDLED BY 
THE COUNTY COURTS IN A SIMPLIFIED WAY.
 WE WILL CONSULT ON A LAY ADJUDICATORS SCHEME TO MAKE IT 
EASIER FOR CITIZENS TO SETTLE DISPUTES WITH SERVICE PROVIDERS.
 WE WILL PROVIDE A CODE OF FAMILY LAW THAT WILL CONTINUE TO 
UNDERPIN THE INSTITUTION OF MARRIAGE, GIVE PRIORITY TO THE WELFARE 
OF THE CHILD, AND EMPHASISE THE PRIMARY RESPONSIBILITY OF 
PARENTS FOR THE WELFARE OF CHILDREN AND THE FAMILY. WE WILL 
BRING FORWARD PROPOSALS FOR REFORM OF THE SUNDAY TRADING LAWS 
ONCE THE LEGAL POSITION 
HAS BEEN MADE CLEAR BY THE EUROPEAN COURT OF JUSTICE
. 
    PORNOGRAPHY, PRIVACY, LIBEL

WE HAVE THE TOUGHEST ANTI-PORNOGRAPHY LAWS IN WESTERN 
EUROPE, AND WE WILL KEEP THEM THAT WAY. EVERY YEAR, ABOUT 
300,000 PEOPLE-MOSTLY WOMEN-REQUEST ADVICE AND 
ASSISTANCE IN DEALING WITH OBSCENE OR MALICIOUS PHONE CALLS. 
WE INTEND TO DO MORE TO DETER THIS HARASSMENT. IN CONJUNCTION 
WITH THE TELECOMMUNICATIONS INDUSTRY. 
    THE PRESS COMPLAINTS COMMISSION IS NOW IN OPERATION, AND 
WE WILL MONITOR ITS WORK CAREFULLY TO SEE IF SELF-REGULATION 
SUCCEEDS. THE PUBLIC'S DISLIKE OF UNPRINCIPLED PRESS BEHAVIOUR 
HAS SOMETIMES BEEN EXPRESSED IN THE AWARD OF ERRATICALLY LARGE 
LIBEL DAMAGES. WHILE THIS IS UNDERSTANDABLE, IT HAS LED TO AN 
INORDINATE NUMBER OF SUCCESSFUL APPEALS. WE THEREFORE PROPOSE 
TO SIMPLIFY THE LAW RELATING TO LIBEL IN THE LIGHT OF THE 
RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE NEILL COMMITTEE.
 BRITISH DOMESTIC CONTROLS ON PORNOGRAPHY WILL REMAIN IN 
PLACE EVEN AFTER THE COMPLETION OF THE SINGLE EUROPEAN MARKET.
 WE WILL INCREASE THE MAXIMUM PENALTIES FOR MAKING OBSCENE 
OR MALICIOUS PHONE CALLS.
 WE PROPOSE TO ALLOW JUDGES TO SETTLE THE LEVEL OF DAMAGES IN 
LIBEL CASES WHERE THE DEFENDANT OFFERS TO PAY TO MAKE AMENDS.
 
COMMUNITY RELATIONS

RACIAL HARMONY DEMANDS RESTRAINT ON ALL SIDES, AND A TOLERANT 
UNDERSTANDING OF THE LEGITIMATE VIEWS OF OTHERS. EVERYBODY, 
REGARDLESS OF ETHNIC BACKGROUND, RELIGIOUS OR PERSONAL BELIEF, 
HAS THE RIGHT TO GO ABOUT HIS OR HER LIFE FREE FROM THE THREAT OF 
INTIMIDATION AND ASSAULT. WE ARE DETERMINED THAT EVERYONE 
LAWFULLY SETTLED IN THIS COUNTRY SHOULD ENJOY THE FULL RANGE OF 
OPPORTUNITIES IN OUR SOCIETY. THAT REQUIRES OPENNESS ON THE PART 
OF THE MAJORITY, AND, ON THE PART OF THE ETHNIC MINORITIES 
THEMSELVES, A DETERMINATION TO PARTICIPATE FULLY IN THE LIFE OF THE 
WIDER COMMUNITY.     THE HOME OFFICE INVESTS £129 MILLION IN 
GRANTS DESIGNED TO ENCOURAGE THOSE RUNNING PUBLIC SERVICES TO 
ENSURE THAT PEOPLE FROM ETHNIC MINORITIES CAN ENJOY THE FULL 
RANGE OF PUBLIC SERVICES- SUCH AS HEALTH, HOUSING AND SOCIAL 
SERVICES. WE BELIEVE THAT THESE GRANTS WOULD BE MORE EFFECTIVE 
IF RESPONSIBILITY WAS TRANSFERRED TO THOSE DEPARTMENTS WHICH 
CAN MAKE BEST USE OF THE MONEY.
 RACIAL AND SEXUAL DISCRIMINATION HAVE NO PLACE IN OUR 
SOCIETY. WE HAVE GIVEN THE POLICE STRONGER POWERS TO DEAL WITH 
RACIAL HATRED. WE WILL CONTINUE TO ENSURE THAT THE FULL FORCE OF 
THE LAW IS USED TO DEAL WITH RACIAL ATTACKS.
 WE WILL TRANSFER THE EDUCATION SHARE OF THE HOME OFFICE'S 
'SECTION 11 ' MONEY TO THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION, TO FOCUS 
HELP ON THOSE FROM ETHNIC MINORITY BACKGROUNDS WHO NEED 
ADDITIONAL ENGLISH LANGUAGE TEACHING
. 
IMMIGRATION AND REFUGEES

GOOD COMMUNITY RELATIONS IN THIS COUNTRY DEPEND UPON A CLEAR 
STRUCTURE OF IMMIGRATION CONTROLS WHICH ARE FAIR, 
UNDERSTANDABLE AND PROPERLY ENFORCED. WE ARE DETERMINED TO 
MAINTAIN OUR PRESENT SYSTEM OF IMMIGRATION CONTROLS UNLESS WE 
HAVE EVIDENCE THAT OTHER ARRANGEMENTS WOULD BE EQUALLY 
SATISFACTORY AND COST-EFFECTIVE. BUT AN INCREASING NUMBER OF 
WOULD-BE IMMIGRANTS FROM EASTERN EUROPE AND OTHER PARTS OF 
THE WORLD SEEK TO ABUSE OUR OPENNESS TO GENUINE REFUGEES. THE 
NUMBER OF PEOPLE SEEKING REFUGEE STATUS HAS RISEN FROM 5,000 A 
YEAR TO 45,000 OVER THE PAST FOUR YEARS. WE WILL CONTINUE TO 
HONOUR OUR COMMITMENT TO THE 1951 UN CONVENTION, AND GIVE 
REFUGE TO THOSE WHO REACH OUR SHORES WITH A WELL-FOUNDED FEAR 
OF PERSECUTION.
 IN THE NEW PARLIAMENT WE MUST THEREFORE REINTRODUCE THE 
ASYLUM BILL, OPPOSED BY LABOUR AND THE LIBERAL DEMOCRATS, TO 
CREATE A FASTER AND MORE EFFECTIVE SYSTEM OF DETERMINING WHO 
ARE GENUINE POLITICAL REFUGEES AND WHO ARE NOT.
 WE WILL PROVIDE A FAIR AND EXPEDITIOUS SYSTEM FOR EXAMINING 
CLAIMS FOR REFUGEE STATUS. THIS WILL INCLUDE A WORKABLE APPEAL 
SYSTEM FOR APPLICANTS UNDER WHICH THOSE WITH MANIFESTLY 
UNFOUNDED CLAIMS WILL BE RETURNED QUICKLY TO THEIR OWN COUNTRY 
OR TO THE COUNTRY THEY CAME FROM.
 FINGER-PRINTING WILL BE INTRODUCED FOR ASYLUM APPLICANTS, TO 
PREVENT MULTIPLE APPLICATIONS AND FRAUDULENT BENEFIT CLAIMS.
 
THE DANGER OF DRUGS

ILLEGAL DRUG ABUSE POSES A MAJOR THREAT TO THE FABRIC OF OUR 
SOCIETY. IT CAN DESTROY THE HEALTH AND LIVES OF YOUNG PEOPLE IN 
PARTICULAR. WE WILL TACKLE THIS PROBLEM WITH VIGOUR. WE HAVE 
ALREADY TAKEN ACTION ON A WIDE FRONT:
 -WE HAVE SET UP CO-ORDINATORS IN EVERY LOCAL EDUCATION 
AUTHORITY TO TRAIN TEACHERS ABOUT THE HARM DRUGS CAN DO, AND TO 
BRING THE FIGHT AGAINST DRUG ABUSE INTO THE CLASSROOM;
 -WE HAVE SET UP 16 LOCAL DRUG PREVENTION TEAMS IN INNER CITIES 
TO TACKLE PARTICULAR PROBLEM AREAS;
 -WE HAVE CREATED THE NATIONAL DRUGS INTELLIGENCE UNIT AT NEW 
SCOTLAND YARD; 
-WE HAVE TAKEN THE LEAD IN EUROPE IN PRESSING FOR THE 
ESTABLISHMENT OF A EUROPE-WIDE DRUGS UNIT, AS A FIRST STEP 
TOWARDS A CREATION OF A 'EUROPOL'; 
-WE HAVE SET UP A NETWORK OF 31 DRUG LIAISON OFFICERS IN 19 
DIFFERENT COUNTRIES, TRACKING THE INTERNATIONAL DRUGS TRAFFICKERS 
WHO THREATEN BRITAIN WITH THEIR TRADE.   
  WE NOW HAVE THE TOUGHEST SANCTIONS IN WESTERN EUROPE 
AGAINST DRUG TRAFFICKERS. A NUMBER OF PUBLIC SERVICES AND 
VOLUNTARY BODIES ARE ENGAGED IN FIGHTING DRUG MISUSE AT LOCAL 
LEVEL. SUCH EFFORTS NEED CO-ORDINATION TO ENSURE THAT LOCAL EFFORT 
AND DEDICATION IS DIRECTED TO BEST EFFECT.
 WE WILL NOT LEGALISE ANY BANNED DRUGS.
 WE WILL BRING FORWARD PROPOSALS TO ENSURE THAT THE CONTROL OF 
DRUG MISUSE IS CO-ORDINATED EFFECTIVELY. 
 WE INTEND TO STRENGTHEN OUR CONFISCATORY POWERS STILL FURTHER. 
AND WE WILL ENSURE THAT OURCONTROLS AGAINST DRUG-TRAFFICKING 
ARE NOT WEAKENED BY ANY CHANGES IN EUROPE.
 WE WILL MAKE IT AN OFFENCE TO SUPPLY ANABOLIC STEROIDS TO 
MINORS.
 
THE THREAT OF TERRORISM

TRAGIC AND DANGEROUS EVENTS REMIND US ONLY TOO FREQUENTLY OF 
THE NEED FOR THE SPECIAL MEASURES PROVIDED BY THE PREVENTION OF 
TERRORISM ACT. WHILE LABOUR PROPOSES TO WEAKEN OR DISMANTLE 
THEM WE KNOW THAT FOR THE SAFETY OF OUR CITIZENS THEY MUST BE 
CONTINUED, AND THE POLICE EFFORT AGAINST TERRORISM MUST BE 
REINFORCED. WE HAVE SET UP IN NEW SCOTLAND YARD 
ARRANGEMENTS TO CO-ORDINATE THE ACTIVITIES OF ALL OUR POLICE 
FORCES IN THE FIGHT AGAINST TERRORISM.  
   WE WILL PROVIDE THE NECESSARY MEASURES AND RESOURCES TO 
COMBAT TERRORISM, WHETHER IT COMES FROM THE IRA OR OTHER EVIL 
GROUPS WHO SEEK TO UNDERMINE OUR DEMOCRACY.









RESPONSIBILITY FOR OTHERS

CONSERVATIVES BELIEVE WE HAVE RESPONSIBILITY ONE FOR ANOTHER. 
WE WILL CONTINUE TO CARE FOR THOSE IN NEED AND WORK TO 
ESTABLISH A SOCIETY THAT IS GENEROUS, AS WELL AS PROSPEROUS. OUR 
HEALTH, CARE AND SOCIAL SECURITY SYSTEMS ARE FUNDAMENTAL TO 
GOVERNMENT RESPONSIBILITIES; AND WE BELIEVE STRONGLY IN 
FOSTERING VOLUNTARY SERVICES TOO.
 
THE NHS PRESENT AND FUTURE

THE CONSERVATIVE PARTY IS TOTALLY COMMITTED TO THE NATIONAL 
HEALTH SERVICE. THE GOVERNMENT HAS SET OUT IN THE PATIENT'S 
CHARTER THE PRINCIPLES ON WHICH THE NHS IS BASED. THE MOST 
FUNDAMENTAL OF THESE IS THAT NEED, AND NOT ABILITY TO PAY, IS AND 
WILL REMAIN THE BASIS ON WHICH CARE IS OFFERED TO ALL BY THE 
NHS. SINCE 1979, THERE HAVE BEEN GREAT IMPROVEMENTS IN THE 
HEALTH OF THE NATION.
-LIFE EXPECTANCY HAS INCREASED BY TWO YEARS.
-DEATHS AMONG BABIES AND VERY YOUNG CHILDREN HAVE GONE 
DOWN BY 40 PER CENT.
 -HOSPITALS ARE TREATING WELL OVER A MILLION MORE PEOPLE A YEAR 
AS IN-PATIENTS.
 -HOSPITALS ARE TREATING OVER TWO MILLION MORE PEOPLE A YEAR 
AS OUT-PATIENTS.
-KIDNEY TRANSPLANTS HAVE MORE THAN DOUBLED.
-HIP REPLACEMENTS HAVE INCREASED BY OVER 50 PER CENT.
 -CORONARY ARTERY BY-PASSES HAVE NEARLY TRIPLED. 
    SINCE 1979 THE GOVERNMENT HAS VASTLY INCREASED THE 
RESOURCES AVAILABLE TO THE NHS.
-WE HAVE INCREASED OVERALL FUNDING FOR THE NHS BY 55 PER 
CENT AFTER ALLOWING FOR INFLATION. THE CASH INCREASES IN EACH OF 
THE THREE YEARS UP TO 1992-3 HAVE BEEN THE BIGGEST EVER.
 -THE NUMBER OF DOCTORS AND DENTISTS HAS BEEN INCREASED BY 
17,000, AND THE REAL RESOURCES COMMITTED TO GP SERVICES HAVE 
DOUBLED SINCE 1979.
 -THE NUMBER OF NURSES AND MIDWIVES HAS GONE UP BY 69,000.
-WE HAVE ESTABLISHED THE INDEPENDENT PAY REVIEW BODY WHICH 
NURSES HAD SOUGHT FOR SO LONG AND INCREASED THEIR PAY BY 43 PER 
CENT. IT IS HARD NOW TO REMEMBER THAT LABOUR ACTUALLY CUT 
NURSES' PAY. 
-WE HAVE RESTORED THE HOSPITAL BUILDING PROGRAMME SO 
SAVAGELY CUT BY LABOUR AT THE END OF THEIR LAST TERM OF OFFICE. 
BUT THE CONSERVATIVE GOVERNMENT HAS NOT SIMPLY SPENT MORE 
MONEY ON THE NHS. 
    -WE HAVE REFORMED THE ORGANISATION OF THE NHS TO 
ENCOURAGE THOSE WORKING IN THE SERVICE TO RESPOND TO WHAT 
PATIENTS WANT AND NEED, AND TO GET THE MOST OUT OF THE INCREASED 
MONEY WHICH THE TAXPAYER PROVIDES.   
  AT LOCAL LEVEL, HEALTH AUTHORITIES NOW HAVE THE TASK OF BUYING 
HEALTH CARE WITH THEIR LOCAL SHARE OF THE NATIONAL HEALTH BUDGET. 
HOSPITALS CAN NOW BE RUN BY THEIR OWN LOCAL TEAM OF DOCTORS, 
NURSES AND MANAGERS.  BY APRIL THERE WILL BE 156 NHS TRUSTS, 
WHOSE LOCAL BOARDS WILL HAVE EXTRA FREEDOMS TO DEVELOP LOCAL 
NHS SERVICES. ANOTHER 156 HOSPITALS HAVE APPLIED TO BECOME 
TRUSTS FROM APRIL 1993.  
   WE HAVE ACTED TO REDUCE THE LONG HOURS WORKED BY JUNIOR 
DOCTORS IN HOSPITALS. FOR THE FIRST TIME LIMITS ARE BEING SET ON 
THE NUMBER OF HOURS WHICH MA, BE WORKED CONTINUOUSLY. GOOD 
NURSING IS THE ESSENTIAL COMPLEMENT TO GOOD MEDICINE. WE HAVE 
INTRODUCED PROJECT 2000 - A NEW APPROACH TO THE PROFESSIONAL 
TRAINING OF NURSES.
     THE GP HAS A CRUCIAL ROLE TO PLAY IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF 
HEALTH SERVICES. UNDER THE GOVERNMENT'S FUND-HOLDING 
INITIATIVE, DOCTORS HAVE CONTROL OVER THEIR OWN SPENDING ON 
BEHALF OF PATIENTS FOR THE FIRST TIME. OVER 3,000 GPS WILL BE 
FUND HOLDERS BY APRIL, CARING FOR 14 PER CENT OF NHS PATIENTS. 
A FURTHER 2,500 ARE PREPARING TO BECOME FUNDHOLDERS IN APRIL 
1993. AS A RESULT, NEW SERVICES ARE BEING OFFERED AT LOCAL 
SURGERIES AND HEALTH CENTRES. MANY GENERAL PRACTITIONERS HAVE 
SAID THAT THEY WOULD LIKE TO BECOME INVOLVED IN FUND-HOLDING. 
WE HAVE ALREADY EXTENDED THE SCOPE OF THE FUND-HOLDING 
SCHEME TO ALLOW GENERAL PRACTITIONERS TO PROVIDE SERVICES SUCH 
AS COMMUNITY NURSING.
 WE WILL, YEAR BY YEAR, INCREASE THE LEVEL OF REAL RESOURCES 
COMMITTED TO THE NHS. SAVINGS MADE THROUGH GREATER 
EFFICIENCY WILL BE PLOUGHED BACK INTO THE SERVICE.
 WE WILL DEVELOP A COMPREHENSIVE RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT 
STRATEGY FOR THE NHS.
 WE WILL CONTINUE TO DEVELOP THE NHS TRUST MOVEMENT WHICH 
PLACES RESPONSIBILITY FOR MANAGING HOSPITALS AND OTHER SERVICES 
WITH LOCAL TEAMS WHO ARE CLOSEST TO PATIENTS. 
  WE WILL CONTINUE TO ENCOURAGE THE INVOLVEMENT OF DOCTORS AND 
OTHER MEDICAL STAFF IN THE MANAGEMENT OF SERVICES.
 WE WILL INTRODUCE POWERS FOR NURSES TO PRESCRIBE WHERE 
APPROPRIATE.
 WE WILL COMPLETE THE IMPLEMENTATION OF PROJECT 2000 
TRAINING FOR NURSES.
 WE WILL SET GOALS FOR THE EMPLOYMENT OF WOMEN IN 
PROFESSIONAL AND MANAGERIAL POSTS IN THE NHS .
 WE WILL ENSURE THAT, FOLLOWING MATERNITY LEAVE OR A 
CAREERBREAK, ALL WOMEN WORKING IN THE NHS, INCLUDING THOSE 
RETURNING TO NURSING ON A PART-TIME OR JOB-SHARING BASIS, ARE 
ABLE TO RETURN TO WORK OF A SIMILAR STATUS OR LEVEL TO THAT WHICH 
THEY LEFT.
 WE WILL ENSURE THAT THE BENEFITS OF FUND-HOLDING 
ARRANGEMENTS ARE AVAILABLE TO ANY GP WHO WISHES TO APPLY, AND 
WE WILL BE READY TO EXTEND THE SCOPE OF THE SCHEME FURTHER AS IT 
DEVELOPS. 

THE PATIENT'S CHARTER

NO ONE QUESTIONS THE DEDICATION OF THOSE WHO WORK IN THE 
NHS. BUT BEFORE THE GOVERNMENT'S REFORMS, THE SYSTEM DID NOT 
ALWAYS ALLOW THAT DEDICATION TO PRODUCE THE SERVICE WHICH 
PEOPLE SHOULD BE ABLE TO EXPECT. THE PATIENT'S CHARTER SETS OUT 
CLEARLY WHAT IS NOW EXPECTED FROM THE NHS. WE HAVE ALREADY 
PLEDGED THAT IN FUTURE NO ONE WILL WAIT MORE THAN TWO YEARS FOR 
TREATMENT ON THE N H S . IN MANY PARTS OF THE COUNTRY, FOR MOST 
TREATMENTS, THE WAITING TIME IS MUCH SHORTER THAN THIS; AND WE 
WILL SEEK FURTHER PROGRESS IN REDUCING WAITING TIMES. 
 BINDING GUARANTEES WILL BE SET LOCALLY FOR IN-PATIENT WAITING 
TIMES, STARTING WITH THE OPERATIONS WHERE WAITING CAUSES MOST 
DISTRESS. TO ENSURE THAT PROGRESS ON WAITING TIMES CONTINUES, WE 
INTEND THAT FROM MARCH 31 1993, NO ONE SHOULD HAVE TO WAIT 
MORE THAN 18 MONTHS FOR A HIP OR KNEE REPLACEMENT, OR A 
CATARACT OPERATION. WE ARE SURE THAT, AS NOW, MANY HOSPITALS 
WILL BE ABLE TO DO BETTER THAN THIS.
 WE WILL MOVE TO A SYSTEM UNDER WHICH A NAMED NURSE OR 
MIDWIFE WILL BE RESPONSIBLE FOR YOUR CARE WHILE YOU ARE IN 
HOSPITAL.
 WE WILL SET SPECIFIC TARGETS FOR OUT-PATIENT WAITING TIMES.
 WE WILL MAKE IT EASIER FOR PATIENTS TO FIND OUT WHAT SERVICES 
ARE AVAILABLE FROM THE NHS VIA A NEW NATIONAL NHS 
INFORMATION SERVICE.
 WE WILL ENSURE THAT COMPARATIVE INFORMATION ABOUT THE HEALTH 
STANDARDS ACHIEVED BY HEALTH AUTHORITIES IS AVAILABLE TO THE 
PUBLIC.
 SIMPLE SYSTEMS WILL BE SET UP TO ALLOW COMPLAINTS TO BE 
REGISTERED AND RESPONSES GIVEN IF THINGS GO WRONG. 

STRATEGY FOR HEALTH

THIS GOVERNMENT HAS EMBARKED ON THE FIRST EVER STRATEGY FOR 
HEALTH. GOOD HEALTH REQUIRES MORE THAN GOOD NHS CARE WHEN 
PEOPLE ARE SICK. A VARIETY OF FACTORS-INCLUDING PREVENTIVE 
MEDICINE, DIET, EXERCISE, SENSIBLE DRINKING AND NOT SMOKING-
CAN CONTRIBUTE SUBSTANTIALLY TO IMPROVING HEALTH ACROSS THE 
WHOLE POPULATION.
 WE WILL SET HEALTH OBJECTIVES TO BE ACHIEVED BY THE END OF THE 
CENTURY, INCLUDING REDUCTIONS IN ILLNESS AND DEATH FROM HEART 
DISEASE AND CANCERS.
 WE WILL ADD NEW HEALTH OBJECTIVES AS THE STRATEGY DEVELOPS.
 
CARE SERVICES

CARE SERVICES FOR CHILDREN, THE ELDERLY AND THE HANDICAPPED ARE 
PROVIDED BY LOCAL GOVERNMENT, HEALTH AUTHORITIES, THE PRIVATE 
SECTOR AND VOLUNTARY GROUPS, NOT DIRECTLY BY CENTRAL 
GOVERNMENT. BUT GOVERNMENT IS INDIRECTLY INVOLVED AS THE 
PROVIDER OF TAXPAYERS' MONEY, AND THROUGH ITS DUTY TO SET 
STANDARDS FOR PUBLICLY AND PRIVATELY PROVIDED CARE.     AS THE 
NUMBER OF ELDERLY PEOPLE IN THE POPULATION GROWS, THERE WILL BE 
MORE FRAIL AND VULNERABLE CITIZENS WHO NEED SUPPORT. MANY OF 
THEM WILL WANT TO BE CARED FOR AT HOME. OTHERS WILL NEED 
RESIDENTIAL OR NURSING HOME CARE. IT IS VITAL THAT PEOPLE SHOULD 
HAVE CHOICE IN THE TYPE OF CARE AVAILABLE. IN ALL CASES PEOPLE 
MUST BE ABLE TO RELY ON THE QUALITY OF CARE. AS WE MOVE 
TOWARDS IMPLEMENTATION OF CARING FOR PEOPLE IN APRIL 1993:
 WE WILL TAKE STEPS TO ENSURE THAT INDIVIDUALS WHO NEED 
RESIDENTIAL OR NURSING CARE CONTINUE TO HAVE A CHOICE OF HOMES, 
INCLUDING INDEPENDENT HOMES. MONEY TRANSFERRED FROM THE 
SOCIAL SECURITY BUDGET TO LOCAL SOCIAL SERVICES DEPARTMENTS WILL 
BE USED FOR THIS PURPOSE.
 WE WILL ENSURE THAT ALL LOCAL AUTHORITIES PUBLISH INFORMATION 
ABOUT THE SOCIAL SERVICES THAT ARE AVAILABLE, INCLUDING 
INFORMATION ON STANDARDS AND COMPLAINTS PROCEDURES.
 WE WILL PROVIDE CHOICE IN DOMICILIARY AND DAY CARE. 
 WE WILL PROVIDE FURTHER FUNDING FOR VOLUNTARY ORGANISATIONS TO 
PLAY THEIR VITAL PART IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF COMMUNITY CARE 
SERVICES.
 WE WILL SUPPORT THE ORGANISATIONS WHICH HELP THOSE WHO CARE 
FOR FRIENDS AND RELATIVES AT HOME. 

CHILDREN

THIS GOVERNMENT INTRODUCED THE CHILDREN ACT, A LANDMARK IN 
LEGISLATION TO PROTECT CHILDREN. THE ACT REQUIRES CHILDCARE 
FACILITIES TO BE REGISTERED TO ENSURE THAT STANDARDS ARE 
MAINTAINED
THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY.  WE BELIEVE THAT THE DIVERSITY OF 
CHILDCARE PROVISION IN THE UK IS ONE OF ITS STRENGTHS. IT OFFERS 
PARENTS REAL CHOICE. OVER 90 PER CENT OF THREE TO FOUR-YEAR-OLDS 
ARE ENGAGED IN SOME FORM OF GROUP ACTIVITY. WE SHALL CONTINUE 
TO ENCOURAGE THE DEVELOPMENT OF CHILDCARE ARRANGEMENTS IN THE 
VOLUNTARY AND INDEPENDENT SECTORS.
 EACH LOCAL AUTHORITY WILL BE ASKED TO PRODUCE A LOCAL 
CHILDCARE PLAN SETTING OUT THE PROVISION AVAILABLE IN THEIR AREA.
 WE WILL ENSURE THAT THE STANDARDS IMPLEMENTED THROUGH THE 
CHILDREN ACT ARE APPLIED SENSIBLY, AND DO NOT DISCOURAGE 
PRIVATE OR VOLUNTARY ARRANGEMENTS WHICH ARE OFTEN BEST SUITED 
TO THE NEEDS OF CHILDREN AND PARENTS.
 WE WILL CARRY FORWARD A FAMILY SUPPORT INITIATIVE, 
ENCOURAGING THE VOLUNTARY SECTOR TO WORK IN PARTNERSHIP WITH 
FAMILIES AND LOCAL AUTHORITIES.
 
SOCIAL SECURITY

OUR AIM IS TO IMPROVE FURTHER AND MODERNISE BRITAIN'S SOCIAL 
SECURITY SYSTEM. WE ARE PROVIDING MORE SUPPORT THAN EVER 
BEFORE-£14 FOR EVERY £10 SPENT IN 1979, AFTER ALLOWING FOR 
INFLATION.  MORE IMPORTANTLY, THIS EXTRA HELP IS MORE CLEARLY 
FOCUSED ON THOSE GROUPS WITH THE GREATEST NEEDS-LESS WELL-OFF 
PENSIONERS, DISABLED PEOPLE AND LOW INCOME FAMILIES. WE HAVE 
ALSO SOUGHT TO PROVIDE THOSE ON SOCIAL SECURITY WITH BETTER 
INCENTIVES TO EARN, AND GAIN INDEPENDENCE. ALL TOO OFTEN THE OLD 
SYSTEM CREATED BARRIERS TO WORK AND PENALISED THE THRIFTY.  
   THE BENEFIT STRUCTURE IS NOW MORE FLEXIBLE AND EASIER TO 
UNDERSTAND. THE NEW BENEFITS AGENCY IS SIMPLIFYING FORMS AND 
WIDENING CHOICE IN METHODS OF PAYMENT. WE WILL COMPLETE THE 
MASSIVE INVESTMENT IN NEW TECHNOLOGY-EUROPE'S BIGGEST 
COMPUTERISATION PROJECT-THAT HAS MADE IT POSSIBLE TO RAISE THE 
QUALITY OF SERVICE TO THE PUBLIC. AND WE WILL EXTEND 'HELPLINES' 
AND OTHER MEANS OF ASSISTANCE WITH INDIVIDUAL DIFFICULTIES.
 WE WILL CONTINUE TO SIMPLIFY SOCIAL SECURITY FORMS WHEREVER 
POSSIBLE.
 WE WILL SET UP A NEW FAMILY CREDIT TELEPHONE ADVICE SERVICE 
TO SUPPORT WORKING FAMILIES.
 WE WILL ESTABLISH A NEW AGENCY TO CARRY OUT ALL SOCIAL 
SECURITY WAR PENSIONS WORK WITH THE AIM OF PROVIDING A BETTER, 
MORE EFFICIENT SERVICE TO WAR PENSIONERS AND WAR WIDOWS. 

SECURITY IN RETIREMENT

BRITAIN'S PENSIONERS RECOGNISE THE SECURITY THAT CONSERVATIVE 
GOVERNMENT BRINGS-LOW INFLATION, SAVINGS THAT GROW, FIRMNESS 
IN THE FACE OF CRIME, PUBLIC SERVICES THAT PUT THE CUSTOMER FIRST. 
THOSE WHO HAVE DEDICATED THEIR LIVES TO THE SERVICE OF THE 
COMMUNITY DESERVE THAT STABILITY. WE WILL CONTINUE TO GIVE THE 
FIGHT AGAINST INFLATION OUR FIRST PRIORITY. THE BASIC STATE 
RETIREMENT PENSION WILL REMAIN THE FOUNDATION FOR RETIREMENT. 
WE WILL CONTINUE TO PROTECT ITS VALUE AGAINST PRICE RISES, AS WE 
HAVE FOR THE LAST 13 YEARS.  
   WE ALSO RECOGNISE THAT SOME PENSIONERS WHO HAVE NO SAVINGS 
OR PENSIONS FROM THEIR JOBS NEED EXTRA HELP. SO WE WILL INCREASE 
THE ADDITIONAL SUPPORT, ALREADY UP BY OVER £300 MILLION A YEAR 
SINCE 1989, AVAILABLE TO LESS WELL-OFF PENSIONERS. THE NUMBER 
OF THOSE OVER PENSIONABLE AGE WILL BE FAR HIGHER IN THE NEXT 
CENTURY THAN IT IS TODAY. IF WE DO NOT MAKE PROVISION NOW, THE 
BURDEN WE WILL PLACE ON OUR CHILDREN WILL BE TOO GREAT. THAT IS 
WHY WE MUST ENCOURAGE PEOPLE TO BUILD UP SAVINGS, 
INVESTMENTS, AND OCCUPATIONAL AND PERSONAL PENSIONS.  
   BUT LABOUR POLICY IS HOSTILE TO SUCH PERSONAL EFFORT; LABOUR 
WANTS PENSIONERS TO DEPEND ON THE STATE. FAILURE TO CONTROL 
INFLATION MEANT THAT PENSIONERS' INCOMES FROM SAVINGS WERE CUT 
UNDER THE LAST LABOUR GOVERNMENT.  
   ABOUT EIGHT IN 10 PENSIONERS HAVE SOME SORT OF SECOND 
INCOME TO TOP UP THEIR STATE PENSION. BY ABOLISHING THE HATED 
EARNINGS RULE WE HAVE ENABLED PENSIONERS TO KEEP THEIR 
RETIREMENT PENSION. EVEN IF THEY TAKE A JOB IN RETIREMENT. AND 
WE HAVE INCREASED THE LEVEL OF SAVINGS THAT IS DISREGARDED IN 
WORKING OUT ENTITLEMENT TO BENEFITS FOR PENSIONERS. PERSONAL 
PENSIONS HAVE BROUGHT REAL CHOICE INTO RETIREMENT PROVISION. 
OVER 4.5 MILLION PEOPLE HAVE SET UP THEIR OWN PENSIONS SINCE 
1988. WE WANT TO SEE BOTH OCCUPATIONAL AND PERSONAL PROVISION 
EXPAND MUCH FURTHER IN THE COURSE OF THE 1990S.
 AS EVIDENCE OF OUR CONTINUING COMMITMENT TO POORER 
PENSIONERS, WE HAVE ANNOUNCED IN THE BUDGET AN INCREASE OF £2 
A WEEK FOR SINGLE PEOPLE, £3 A WEEK FOR COUPLES, IN INCOME 
SUPPORT FOR PENSIONERS. COMBINED WITH THE INCREASES THIS APRIL, 
THIS MEASURE WILL PROVIDE LESS WELL-OFF PENSIONERS WITH BETWEEN 
£5.75 AND £10.70 A WEEK EXTRA. 
 WE WILL CONTINUE TO PAY, FROM APRIL 1993, A REBATE AT THE LEVEL 
RECOMMENDED BY THE GOVERNMENT ACTUARY FOR ALL THOSE WHO 
CONTRACT OUT OF THE STATE EARNINGS RELATED PENSION SCHEME.
 WE WILL LEGISLATE TO PROVIDE A NEW ONE PER CENT INCENTIVE FOR 
HOLDERS OF PERSONAL PENSIONS AGED 30 AND OVER FROM APRIL 
1993, WHEN THE EXISTING INCENTIVE ENDS.
 WE WILL CONSIDER PROPOSALS FOR A NEW SYSTEM OF REBATES TO 
COME INTO EFFECT FROM APRIL 1996 WITH THE AIM OF ENSURING THAT 
PERSONAL PENSIONS REMAIN ATTRACTIVE ACROSS THE AGE RANGE.
 WE ARE FIRMLY COMMITTED TO EQUAL TREATMENT FOR MEN AND 
WOMEN IN PENSIONS. FOLLOWING ASSESSMENT OF THE RESPONSES TO 
OUR DISCUSSION PAPER, WE WILL BRING FORWARD LEGISLATION TO 
ACHIEVE THIS.
 
SUPPORTING FAMILIES

OUR REFORMS HAVE CUT AWAY THE BARRIERS THAT MEANT MANY 
BREADWINNERS LOST MONEY IF THEY WENT TO WORK. FAMILY CREDIT 
HAS TRANSFORMED THE PROSPECTS OF 350,000 LOW-INCOME FAMILIES. 
AS A RESULT OF IMPROVEMENTS SINCE 1988, WE HAVE MADE 
AVAILABLE AN EXTRA £600 MILLION A YEAR IN REAL TERMS TO LOW-
INCOME FAMILIES WITH CHILDREN. BUT WE ALSO RECOGNISE THAT ALL 
FAMILIES FACE EXTRA COSTS IN BRINGING UP CHILDREN. SO WE HAVE 
RAISED CHILD BENEFIT. FOR A TWO-CHILD FAMILY THE INCREASES WE ARE 
MAKING WILL, BY APRIL 1992, HAVE RAISED THE TOTAL VALUE OF CHILD 
BENEFIT BY ALMOST £3 IN A SINGLE YEAR, TO £17.45 A WEEK.   
  OUR NEW CHILD SUPPORT AGENCY WILL MAKE SURE THAT ABSENT 
PARENTS MAKE A PROPER CONTRIBUTION -AND THAT FAR MORE LONE 
PARENTS AND THEIR CHILDREN GET THE MAINTENANCE THAT IS THEIRS BY 
RIGHT AND BENEFIT CHANGES MAKE IT EASIER FOR MORE FAMILIES-
INCLUDING SINGLE PARENTS-TO COMBINE WORK AND FAMILY 
RESPONSIBILITIES.
 CHILD BENEFIT WILL REMAIN THE CORNERSTONE OF OUR POLICY FOR ALL 
FAMILIES WITH CHILDREN. ITS VALUE WILL INCREASE EACH YEAR IN LINE 
WITH PRICES.
 CHILD BENEFIT WILL CONTINUE TO BE PAID TO ALL FAMILIES, 
NORMALLY TO THE MOTHER, AND IN RESPECT OF ALL CHILDREN. 

HELP FOR DISABLED PEOPLE

UNDER THE CONSERVATIVES, MORE DISABLED PEOPLE THAN EVER 
BEFORE ARE GETTING THE HELP THEY NEED AND DESERVE. SINCE 1979, 
THE NUMBER RECEIVING ATTENDANCE ALLOWANCE HAS MORE THAN 
TREBLED; THE NUMBER RECEIVING MOBILITY ALLOWANCE HAS RISEN SIX-
FOLD; THE NUMBER RECEIVING INVALID CARE ALLOWANCE HAS RISEN 25-
FOLD. TODAY WE SPEND SOME £12,000 MILLION A YEAR ON BENEFITS 
FOR LONG-TERM SICK AND DISABLED PEOPLE. EVEN AFTER ALLOWING FOR 
INFLATION, THAT IS TWO-AND-A-HALF TIMES AS MUCH AS LABOUR SPENT 
IN THE 1970S.
 -DISABILITY LIVING ALLOWANCE WILL BRING TOGETHER THE EXISTING 
ATTENDANCE AND MOBILITY ALLOWANCE, PROVIDING NEW HELP TO 
MANY DISABLED PEOPLE WHO AT PRESENT GET NO SUCH HELP. 
DISABILITY WORKING ALLOWANCE WILL MAKE IT EASIER FOR DISABLED 
PEOPLE TO TAKE UP A JOB.
 WE ARE INTRODUCING NEW DISABILITY BENEFITS WHICH WILL, IN THE 
NEXT PARLIAMENT, BRING EXTRA HELP TO AT LEAST 300,000 PEOPLE. BY 
1993-4 THESE AND OTHER IMPROVEMENTS WILL MEAN THAT WE WILL BE 
DIRECTING AN EXTRA £300 MILLION A YEAR TO LONG-TERM SICK AND 
DISABLED PEOPLE.
 THE INDEPENDENT LIVING FUND HAS PROVED A GREAT SUCCESS IN 
GIVING SEVERELY DISABLED PEOPLE AN OPPORTUNITY TO LIVE IN THE 
COMMUNITY. WE ARE COMMITTED TO MAINTAINING A FUND WHICH 
SUPPORTS THE MOST SEVERELY DISABLED PEOPLE.
 
THE VOLUNTARY SECTOR

CHARITIES AND VOLUNTARY GROUPS PLAY A VITAL ROLE IN OUR NATIONAL 
LIFE. BRITAIN IS RICH IN ITS CITIZENS' WILLINGNESS TO GIVE TIME, 
EFFORT AND MONEY TO HELPING OTHERS. WE HAVE A GREAT TRADITION 
OF VOLUNTARY WORK AT HOME AND OVERSEAS. THERE ARE NOW ABOUT 
350,000 VOLUNTARY GROUPS IN BRITAIN-AND PERSONAL DONATIONS 
TO CHARITIES NOW AMOUNT TO SOME £5 ,000 MILLION A YEAR. WE 
HAVE DONE MUCH TO BOOST CHARITABLE GIVING.
 -UNDER THE PAYROLL GIVING SCHEME, EMPLOYEES CAN NOW 
CONTRIBUTE UP TO £50 A MONTH TAX-FREE 
-GIFTS AND BEQUESTS HAVE BEEN EXEMPTED FROM INHERITANCE TAX. 
-THE GIFT AID SCHEME ALLOWS CHARITIES TO CLAIM TAX RELIEF ON 
ONE-OFF GIFTS OF MORE THAN £400-A CHANGE JUST ANNOUNCED IN 
THE BUDGET.
 -THE MAXIMUM LIMIT ON SINGLE CHARITABLE GIFTS QUALIFYING FOR 
INCOME AND CORPORATION TAX RELIEF HAS BEEN ABOLISHED.   
  THE NEW CHARITIES LEGISLATION WILL ENSURE THAT CHARITIES ARE 
BETTER MANAGED AND PROPERLY REGULATED. WE BELIEVE THIS WILL 
ENHANCE PUBLIC CONFIDENCE IN CHARITIES AND FURTHER BOOST 
CHARITABLE GIVING.  
   THE GOVERNMENT GIVES SOME £2,500 MILLION A YEAR TO SUPPORT 
THE ACTIVITIES OF THE VOLUNTARY SECTOR (INCLUDING HOUSING 
ASSOCIATIONS). INDUSTRY HAS BEEN GENEROUS WITH ITS SPONSORSHIP 
AND WITH TECHNICAL SUPPORT. BUT MONEY IS NOT THE ONLY 
CONTRIBUTION THAT GOVERNMENT AND BUSINESS CAN MAKE. 
BUSINESSES HAVE BECOME MUCH MORE PRACTICALLY INVOLVED IN 
WORK IN THE COMMUNITY. AND GOVERNMENT COULD DO MORE TO 
ENCOURAGE NEW FORMS OF VOLUNTEERING, TO ENCOURAGE THE MOST 
EFFECTIVE USE OF THE MONEY IT GIVES, AND TO BRING TOGETHER 
VOLUNTARY EFFORT AT THE LOCAL AND NATIONAL LEVEL.
 WE WILL CONTINUE TO SUPPORT THE WORK OF THE VOLUNTARY SECTOR 
AND PROMOTE VOLUNTEERING.
 WE WILL WORK WITH VOLUNTARY AGENCIES TO DEVELOP, OVER THE 
LIFE OF THE NEXT PARLIAMENT, A NATIONAL BANK OF INFORMATION ON 
OPPORTUNITIES FOR VOLUNTEERING.
 WE WILL ENCOURAGE EFFORTS TO IMPROVE THE CO-ORDINATION AND 
PROMOTE THE GROWTH OF LOCAL VOLUNTEER SUPPORT, BUILDING ON THE 
SUCCESS OF NEIGHBOURHOOD WATCH TO DEVELOP A NETWORK OF 
VOLUNTARY HELP IN LOCAL COMMUNITIES. 

ANIMAL WELFARE

WE ARE LEADING THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITY IN OUR ACHIEVEMENTS 
IN IMPROVING ANIMAL WELFARE. WE HAVE ALSO TAKEN ACTION AT 
HOME AND ABROAD TO IMPROVE CONSERVATION, AND WILL CONTINUE TO 
DO SO. ENGLISH NATURE, WHICH ADVISES THE GOVERNMENT ON 
WILDLIFE ISSUES, HAS EMBARKED ON AN AMBITIOUSPROGRAMME TO 
RESTORE ENDANGERED SPECIES. THE WILDLIFE AND COUNTRY SIDE ACT 
1981 PROVIDES SPECIAL PROTECTION FOR 304 SPECIES OF BIRDS AND 
ANIMALS. AS WELL AS PROTECTING OUR HERITAGE OF WILD PLANTS.   
  WE ARE FIRMLY OPPOSED TO INTERNATIONAL TRADE IN RARE AND 
PROTECTED SPECIES SUCH AS RHINOCEROSES, CHEETAHS, LEOPARDS, AND 
BEARS. WE HAVE PUSHED SUCCESSFULLY FOR AN EC BAN ON LARGE 
SCALE DRIFT NETS THAT THREATENED DOLPHINS, AND WE SUPPORT THE UN 
RESOLUTION CALLING FOR A MORATORIUM ON THEIR USE. WE SUPPORT 
THE EXTENSION OF THE MORATORIUM ON COMMERCIAL WHALING AND 
HAVE CO-SPONSORED RESOLUTIONS AGAINST 'SCIENTIFIC' HUNTING OF 
WHALES. WE HAVE SUCCESSFULLY PRESSED FOR AN EC BAN ON THE 
IMPORT OF BABY SEAL PRODUCTS AND OF FURS FROM THOSE COUNTRIES 
WHICH PERMIT LEGHOLD TRAPS.  
   WE HAVE SET UP THE FARM ANIMAL WELFARE COUNCIL AND HAVE 
BROUGHT IN WELFARE CODES COVERING LIVESTOCK ON FARMS AND IN 
TRANSIT. WE ARE ESTABLISHING AN ETHICAL COMMITTEE TO LOOK AT THE 
EFFECTS OF ADVANCED TECHNIQUES IN ANIMAL BREEDING. WE HAVE 
BANNED THE USE OF VEAL CRATES, AND TAKEN ACTION TO ENSURE 
HUMANE SLAUGHTER. WE INSISTED THAT WE SHOULD RETAIN OUR POWER 
TO STOP THE EXPORT OF LIVE HORSES. AT MAASTRICHT WE SECURED A 
LANDMARK IN ANIMAL WELFARE: OUR PARTNERS' AGREEMENT TO A 
DECLARATION THAT THE WELFARE OF ANIMALS SHOULD BE TAKEN INTO 
ACCOUNT IN THE FRAMING OF EC LEGISLATION.  
   WE NOW HAVE THE TOUGHEST SET OF CONTROLS ON ANIMAL 
EXPERIMENTATION IN EUROPE, AND THE NUMBER OF ANIMALS USED IN 
EXPERIMENTS HAS FALLEN STEADILY. WE HAVE SUPPORTED STRONGER 
LAWS TO PROTECT BADGERS AND STOP CRUEL TETHERING, AND HAVE 
INCREASED THE PENALTIES FOR ORGANISING ANIMAL FIGHTS AND FOR 
CRUELTY.
 WE WILL INTRODUCE A WILDLIFE ENHANCEMENT SCHEME AND 
EXPAND THE SPECIES RECOVERY SCHEME, BOTH TO BE RUN BY ENGLISH 
NATURE.
 WE HAVE TIGHTENED CONTROLS ON THE IMPORT OF WILD BIRDS AND 
WILL PRESS THE EC TO DO THE SAME.
 WE OPPOSE RESUMPTION OF THE TRADE IN IVORY OR ELEPHANT 
PRODUCTS, AND WILL PROVIDE ADDITIONAL SUPPORT FOR ELEPHANT 
CONSERVATION PROJECTS IN AFRICA.
 WE WILL URGE OUR EC PARTNERS TO BRING ANIMAL WELFARE 
STANDARDS UP TO UK LEVELS, FOR EXAMPLE BY BANNING VEAL CRATES 
AND STALLS AND TETHERS FOR PIGS. WE WILL PRESS THEM TO PUT INTO 
PRACTICE THE PRINCIPLES OF THE MAASTRICHT DECLARATION.
 WE WILL USE OUR EC PRESIDENCY TO TOUGHEN UP EC REGULATIONS 
AND IMPROVE EC COMPLIANCE WITH RULES GOVERNING ANIMAL 
EXPERIMENTS.
 WE WILL PRESS FOR HIGHER EC STANDARDS FOR THE KEEPING OF 
BATTERY HENS AND FOR THE CARE OF ANIMALS IN TRANSLT.
 WE WILL NOT ACCEPT ANY WEAKENING OF OUR RABIES PREVENTION 
SAFEGUARDS.
 
A BRIGHTER BRITAIN

MAKING BRITAIN A BRIGHTER AND BETTER PLACE IN WHICH TO LIVE 
REQUIRES A HIGH QUALITY PHYSICAL ENVIRONMENT-INCLUDING 
HOUSING, TRANSPORT AND REINVIGORATED URBAN AREAS. THE 
CONSERVATIVE COMMITMENT IS BOTH TO THE RE-CREATION OF OUR CIVIC 
PRIDE AND ALSO TO THE PRESERVATION AND INTEGRITY OF OUR RURAL 
HERITAGE, FOUNDED ON THE CORE INDUSTRY OF AGRICULTURE. OUR AIM 
IS TO ENHANCE LIFE FOR THE BRITISH PEOPLE
. 
HOME OWNERSHIP

THE OPPORTUNITY TO OWN A HOME AND PASS IT ON IS ONE OF THE 
MOST IMPORTANT RIGHTS AN INDIVIDUAL HAS IN A FREE SOCIETY. 
CONSERVATIVES HAVE EXTENDED THAT RIGHT. IT LIES AT THE HEART OF 
OUR PHILOSOPHY. WE WANT TO SEE WEALTH AND SECURITY BEING 
PASSED DOWN FROM GENERATION TO GENERATION. SOME FOUR MILLION 
MORE HOUSEHOLDERS OWN THEIR OWN HOMES COMPARED WITH 1979. 
THE NUMBER OF FORMER COUNCIL TENANTS WHO HAVE BOUGHT THEIR 
HOMES HAS RISEN TO 1.4 MILLION.  
   WE NOW NEED TO MAKE IT EASIER FOR THOSE COUNCIL TENANTS 
LIVING IN HIGH-COST AREAS OR ON LOW INCOMES TO MOVE GRADUALLY 
INTO HOME OWNERSHIP, WITHOUT TAKING ON TOO HEAVY A FINANCIAL 
BURDEN AT ANY ONE TIME. THIS WILL BRING THE BENEFITS OF HOME 
OWNERSHIP WITHIN THE REACH OF MORE PEOPLE AND INTRODUCE MORE 
DIVERSITY IN LOCAL AUTHORITY ESTATES. WE ALSO WANT TO HELP MORE 
LEASEHOLDERS TO OWN AND CONTROL THE MANAGEMENT OF THEIR 
PROPERTY.
     BUT WE RECOGNISE THAT NOT EVERYONE CAN, OR WILL WANT TO, BUY 
HIS OR HER HOME. SO WE ARE DETERRNINED TO ENCOURAGE A STRONG 
PRIVATE RENTED SECTOR WHILE CONTINUING TO SAFEGUARD THE RIGHTS OF 
EXISTING REGULATED TENANTS. BRINGING EMPTY PRIVATE SECTOR 
DWELLINGS BACK INTO USE WILL EXTEND CHOICE, MAKE IT EASIER FOR 
PEOPLE TO MOVE JOBS, AND HELP TACKLE HOMELESSNESS.
 WE WILL MAINTAIN MORTGAGE TAX RELIEF.
 WE WILL CONTINUE 'RIGHT TO BUY' DISCOUNTS AND ENSURE THAT LOCAL 
AUTHORITIES RESPOND REASONABLY AND RAPIDLY TO APPLICATIONS.
 WE WILL INTRODUCE A NEW NATION-WIDE 'RENTS TO MORTGAGES' 
SCHEME, ENABLING COUNCIL TENANTS TO TAKE A PART-SHARE IN THEIR 
HOME, GRADUALLY STEPPING UP TO FULL OWNERSHIP.
 WE WILL PUT MORE OF THE HOUSING CORPORATION'S £2,000 
MILLION BUDGET INTO DO-IT-YOURSELF SHARED OWNERSHIP. THIS WILL 
ENABLE FIRST TIME BUYERS TO CHOOSE A HOME AND BUY A SHARE OF 
IT-USUALLY 50 PER CENT-WITH A HOUSING ASSOCIATION PAYING RENT 
ON THE REST UNTIL THEY WISH TO INCREASE THEIR STAKE IN THE 
PROPERTY. 
FLATS THE RIGHT TO ACQUIRE THE FREEHOLD OF THEIR BLOCK AT THE 
MARKET RATE. LEASEHOLDERS OF HIGHER RATED HOUSES WILL ALSO BE 
GIVEN THE RIGHT TO BUY THE FREEHOLD OF THEIR PROPERTY. 
LEASEHOLDERS WHO LIVE IN A BLOCK WHICH DOES NOT QUALIFY WILL 
HAVE A NEW RIGHT TO BUY AN EXTENDED LEASE.
 WE WILL INTRODUCE STATUTORY TIME LIMITS FOR ANSWERS BY LOCAL 
AUTHORITIES TO STANDARD ENQUIRIES BY HOUSE-BUYERS, AND EXPLORE 
THE IDEA OF A NEW COMPUTERISED PROPERTY DATA BANK BRINGING 
TOGETHER INFORMATION HELD BY THE LAND REGISTRY AND OTHER 
PUBLIC BODIES.
 WE WILL EXTEND NATION-WIDE THE SCHEME WE HAVE PILOTED TO 
INCREASE PRIVATE RENTING, WHEREBY HOUSING ASSOCIATIONS MANAGE 
PROPERTIES, BUILDING TRUST BETWEEN TENANT AND PRIVATE SECTOR 
LANDLORD.
 AS SOON AS POSSIBLE IN THE NEW PARLIAMENT, WE WILL INTRODUCE 
A NEW 'RENT A ROOM' SCHEME UNDER WHICH HOME-OWNERS WILL BE 
ABLE TO LET ROOMS TO LODGERS WITHOUT HAVING TO PAY TAX ON THE 
RENT THEY RECEIVE.
 
MEETING HOUSING NEED

WE ARE ALSO COMMITTED TO SECURING A BETTER DEAL FOR COUNCIL 
TENANTS AND INCREASING THE SUPPLY OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING FOR 
THOSE IN HOUSING NEED. WE WILL INTRODUCE MORE CHOICE, IMPROVE 
MANAGEMENT OF ESTATES AND CREATE NEW RIGHTS AS PART OF THE 
TENANT'S CHARTER. OUR AIM WILL BE TO GIVE TENANTS A CHOICE OF 
LANDLORD WHEREVER POSSIBLE, AND MAKE MANAGEMENT OF BOTH 
COUNCIL AND HOUSING ASSOCIATION STOCK MORE RESPONSIVE TO THE 
NEEDS OF TENANTS.  
   WE WILL IMPROVE THE WAY IN WHICH COUNCIL HOUSING IS 
MANAGED BY BRINGING IN NEW PRIVATE SECTOR PROVIDERS OPERATING 
ON CONTRACT TO THE LOCAL AUTHORITY. WE WILL INTRODUCE MORE 
COMPETITION AND CHOICE, THEREBY IMPROVING SERVICES TO THE 
TENANT AND INCREASING ACCOUNTABILITY. AND WE INTEND TO GIVE 
COUNCIL TENANTS NEW OPPORTUNITIES THEMSELVES TO IMPROVE THE 
FLAT OR HOUSE IN WHICH THEY LIVE.   
  WE HAVE ALREADY BEGUN A PROCESS OF LARGE-SCALE VOLUNTARY 
TRANSFER WHICH ALLOWS LOCAL AUTHORITY TENANTS TO OPT TO TRANSFER 
TO A HOUSING ASSOCIATION. WE WISH TO SEE THIS RESULT IN DIVERSITY, 
NOT LOCAL MONOPOLY, AND WILL THEREFORE ACT TO LIMIT THE SIZE OF 
BLOCKS THAT CAN BE TRANSFERRED.   
  NEARLY ALL NEW SOCIAL HOUSING IS NOW BEING BUILT BY HOUSING 
ASSOCIATIONS. OVER THE NEXT THREE YEARS, WE ARE COMMITTED TO 
SPEND NEARLY £6,000 MILLION THROUGH THE HOUSING CORPORATION 
TO PROVIDE 153,000 HOMES. WE WILL DO MORE TO BRING INTO USE 
PROPERTIES OWNED BY CENTRAL AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT WHICH ARE 
STANDING EMPTY FOR NO GOOD REASON. THIS WILL ENABLE US TO 
HOUSE MORE PEOPLE ON THE WAITING LIST AND, IN SOME CASES, TO 
PROVIDE MORE OPPORTUNITIES FOR HOMESTEADING.   
  THROUGH ESTATE ACTION AND HOUSING ACTION TRUSTS WE HAVE 
INVESTED £1.000 MILLION IN RECENT YEARS IN A CONCENTRATED ATTACK 
ON THE COUNTRY'S WORST HOUSING ESTATES. SOME 360,000 
DWELLINGS HAVE BEEN IMPROVED AS A RESULT. AS PART OF THOSE 
PROGRAMMES, ON WHICH WE ARE COMMITTED TO SPEND A FURTHER 
£1,400 MILLION OVER THE NEXT THREE YEARS, WE ARE DEMOLISHING OR 
REDESIGNING TOWER BLOCKS AND DECK ACCESS ESTATES, REBUILDING ON 
A MORE HUMAN SCALE. WHEREVER WE CAN, WHENEVER TENANTS WANT 
IT, AND WHERE RESOURCES ALLOW, WE WILL PULL DOWN THE EYESORES 
WHICH HAVE BLOTTED OUR CITYSCAPES AND TOO OFTEN PROVIDED 
BREEDING GROUNDS FOR CRIME AND DELINQUENCY. 
    THE GOVERNMENT IS SPENDING ABOUT £100 MILLION TACKLING THE 
PROBLEM OF ROUGH SLEEPING IN OUR CITIES. AS A RESULT WE HAVE 
SEEN A SHARP FALL IN THE NUMBERS WHO SLEEP ROUGH ON OUR STREETS. 
WORKING CLOSELY WITH THE VOLUNTARY SECTOR WE WILL CONTINUE TO 
PROVIDE HELP FOR THOSE SLEEPING ROUGH, PARTICULARLY IN THE 
CAPITAL.
 WE WILL REVOLUTIONISE THE MANAGEMENT OF COUNCIL HOUSES AND 
FLATS. COMPULSORY COMPETITIVE TENDERING WILL OBLIGE LOCAL 
AUTHORITIES TO BRING IN MANAGERS WHO DEMONSTRATE THEIR ABILITY 
TO DELIVER THE BEST SERVICES TO TENANTS.
 WE WILL CONTINUE OUR PROGRAMME OF LARGE-SCALE VOLUNTARY 
TRANSFER OF COUNCIL PROPERTIES TO HOUSING ASSOCIATIONS. BUT IN 
ORDER TO BRING MANAGEMENT CLOSER TO TENANTS, WE INTEND TO 
REDUCE THE LIMIT ON THE NUMBER OF PROPERTIES TRANSFERRED IN A 
SINGLE BATCH.
 WE WILL GIVE TENANTS A NEW 'RIGHT TO IMPROVE', SO THEY CAN 
RECEIVE COMPENSATION FOR CERTAIN HOME IMPROVEMENTS WHICH 
THEY UNDERTAKE. AND WE WILL IMPROVE THE EXISTING 'RIGHT TO 
REPAIR'.
 WE WILL CONTINUE OUR ESTATE ACTION AND HOUSING ACTION TRUST 
PROGRAMMES WHICH CONCENTRATE RESOURCES ON THE WORST COUNCIL 
ESTATES. 
 WE WILL ENABLE TENANTS TO APPLY FOR HOUSING ACTION TRUSTS TO 
TAKE OVER AND IMPROVE THE WORST ESTATES.
WE WILL WORK WITH THE HOUSING CORPORATION TO ESTABLISH A 
NEW OMBUDSMAN FOR HOUSING ASSOCIATION TENANTS. WE WILL ALSO 
ENCOURAGE THE CORPORATION TO EXTEND OPPORTUNITIES FOR TENANT 
INVOLVEMENT IN THE MANAGEMENT OF HOUSING ASSOCIATION 
PROPERTIES.
 WE WILL SET UP A TASK FORCE-HEADED BY AN INDEPENDENT 
CHAIRMAN-TO HELP BRING EMPTY GOVERNMENT RESIDENTIAL 
PROPERTIES BACK INTO USE. THESE WILL EITHER BE SOLD OR LET ON 
SHORT TERM LEASES TO THOSE IN HOUSING NEED.
 AS PART OF ESTATE ACTION WE WILL INTRODUCE A NEW PILOT SCHEME 
TO PROMOTE HOMESTEADING. LOCAL AUTHORITIES WILL BE ENCOURAGED 
TO OFFER THOSE IN HOUSING NEED THE OPPORTUNITY TO RESTORE AND 
IMPROVE COUNCIL PROPERTIES. IN EXCHANGE, HOMESTEADERS WILL 
PAY A LOWER RENT OR BE ABLE TO BUY AT A REDUCED PRICE.

TRANSPORT

UNDER THE CONSERVATIVES, TRANSPORT IN BRITAIN IS BEING 
TRANSFORMED. MORE COMPETITION ON THE ROADS AND IN THE AIR HAS 
LED TO BETTER SERVICES AND MORE CHOICE. OUR SUCCESSFUL POLICIES 
OF DEREGULATION AND PRIVATISATION HAVE GONE HAND-IN-HAND WITH 
A SUSTAINED AND GROWING PROGRAMME OF INVESTMENT. OVER 1,000 
MILES OF NEW TRUNK ROADS AND MOTORWAY HAVE BEEN BUILT, MORE 
THAN 100 BYPASSES CONSTRUCTED, AND SOME 750 MILES OF RAILWAY 
ELECTRIFIED. AIRLINES NOW OPERATE 50 PER CENT MORE FLIGHTS. MORE 
PEOPLE TRAVEL FARTHER AND MORE EASILY THAN EVER BEFORE.  
   OVER THE NEXT THREE YEARS WE ARE COMMITTED TO THE BIGGEST 
INVESTMENT IN BRITAIN'S TRANSPORT INFRASTRUCTURE IN OUR HISTORY. 
WE WILL ALSO SEEK FURTHER OPPORTUNITIES FOR THE PRIVATE SECTOR TO 
CONTRIBUTE, AS IT HAS FOR EXAMPLE WITH THE CHANNEL TUNNEL, THE 
QUEEN ELIZABETH II BRIDGE AT DARTFORD, THE SECOND SEVERN 
BRIDGE AND THE BIRMINGHAM NORTHERN RING ROAD. WE INTEND THE 
PROPOSED NEW RAIL LINK FROM THE CHANNEL TUNNEL TO KING'S CROSS 
TO BE TAKEN FORWARD BY THE PRIVATE SECTOR.
 
THE RAILWAYS

WE BELIEVE THAT THE RAILWAYS CAN PLAY A BIGGER PART IN 
RESPONDING TO BRITAIN'S GROWING TRANSPORT NEEDS, AND ARE 
INVESTING ACCORDINGLY. NEXT YEAR ALONE, BRITISH RAIL'S EXTERNAL 
FINANCE WILL TOP £2,000 MILLION. THE NEW PASSENGER'S CHARTER 
WILL HELP TO RAISE THE QUALITY OF SERVICE. FOR THE FIRST TIME EVER 
PERFORMANCE TARGETS WILL BE SET, WIDELY PUBLISHED AND 
RIGOROUSLY MONITORED; FARE LEVELS WILL REFLECT THE STANDARDS SET; 
AND DISCOUNTS WILL BE PAID TO REGULAR TRAVELLERS WHERE 
PERFORMANCE TARGETS ARE NOT MET.   
  WE BELIEVE THAT THE BEST WAY TO PRODUCE PROFOUND AND LASTING 
IMPROVEMENTS ON THE RAILWAYS IS TO END BR'S STATE MONOPOLY. 
WE WANT TO RESTORE THE PRIDE AND LOCAL COMMITMENT THAT DIED 
WITH NATIONALISATION. WE WANT TO GIVE THE PRIVATE SECTOR THE 
OPPORTUNITY TO OPERATE EXISTING RAIL SERVICES AND INTRODUCE NEW 
ONES, FOR BOTH PASSENGERS AND FREIGHT. A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF 
COMPANIES HAVE ALREADY SAID THAT THEY WANT TO INTRODUCE NEW 
RAILWAY SERVICES AS SOON AS THE MONOPOLY IS ENDED. WE WILL 
GIVE THEM THAT CHANCE.  
   OUR PLANS FOR THE RAILWAYS ARE DESIGNED TO BRING BETTER 
SERVICES FOR ALL PASSENGERS AS RAPIDLY AS POSSIBLE. WE BELIEVE 
THAT FRANCHISING PROVIDES THE BEST WAY OF ACHIEVING THAT. LONG 
TERM, AS PERFORMANCE IMPROVES AND SERVICES BECOME MORE 
COMMERCIALLY ATTRACTIVE AS A RESULT OF BRINGING IN PRIVATE SECTOR 
DISCIPLINES, IT WILL MAKE SENSE TO CONSIDER WHETHER SOME 
SERVICES CAN BE SOLD OUTRIGHT. IN THE NEXT PARLIAMENT:
 BY FRANCHISING, WE WILL GIVE THE PRIVATE SECTOR THE FULLEST 
OPPORTUNITY TO OPERATE EXISTING PASSENGER RAILWAY SERVICES.
 REQUIRED STANDARDS OF PUNCTUALITY, RELIABILITY AND QUALITY OF 
SERVICE WILL BE SPECIFIED BY FRANCHISES; SUBSIDY WILL CONTINUE TO 
BE PROVIDED WHERE NECESSARY; ARRANGEMENTS TO SUSTAIN THE 
CURRENT NATIONAL NETWORK OF SERVICES WILL BE MAINTAINED; AND 
THROUGH-TICKETING WILL BE REQUIRED.
 A NEW RAIL REGULATOR-WHO WILL ENSURE THAT ALL COMPANIES 
HAVE FAIR ACCESS TO THE TRACK-WILL AWARD THE FRANCHISES AND 
MAKE SURE THAT THE FRANCHISEES HONOUR THE TERMS OF THE CONTRACT.
 BR'S ACCOUNTING SYSTEMS AND INTERNAL STRUCTURES WILL BE 
REORGANISED. ONE PART OF BR WILL CONTINUE TO BE RESPONSIBLE FOR 
ALL TRACK AND INFRASTRUCTURE. THE OPERATING SIDE OF BR WILL 
CONTINUE TO PROVIDE PASSENGER SERVICES UNTIL THEY ARE FRANCHISED 
OUT TO THE PRIVATE SECTOR.
 THE FRANCHISE AREAS WILL BE DECIDED ONLY AFTER TECHNICAL 
DISCUSSIONS WITH BR. BUT OUR AIM WILL BE TO FRANCHISE OUT 
SERVICES IN SUCH A WAY AS TO REFLECT REGIONAL AND LOCAL IDENTITY 
AND MAKE OPERATING SENSE. WE WANT TO RECOVER A SENSE OF PRIDE 
IN OUR RAILWAYS AND TO RECAPTURE THE SPIRIT OF THE OLD REGIONAL 
COMPANIES.
 WE WILL SELL BR'S FREIGHT OPERATIONS OUTRIGHT. WE WILL ALSO 
SELL ITS PARCELS BUSINESS.
 WE WILL BE PREPARED TO SELL STATIONS WHICH WE WANT TO BE 
CENTRES OF ACTIVITY-EITHER TO FRANCHISEES OR INDEPENDENT 
COMPANIES.
 THE RAILWAY INSPECTORATE WILL BE GIVEN FULL POWERS TO ENSURE 
THE HIGHEST STANDARDS OF SAFETY. 

ROADS

NINE OUT OF EVERY TEN JOURNEYS, WHETHER PASSENGER OR FREIGHT, 
ARE MADE BY ROAD. WE MUST THEREFORE CONTINUE TO PROVIDE AN 
EFFICIENT ROAD NETWORK. IN THE YEARS AHEAD WE WILL CONCENTRATE 
PARTICULARLY ON THE BYPASS PROGRAMME. AS PART OF THE CITIZEN'S 
CHARTER, WE WILL BRING FORWARD REFORMS WHICH WILL ENABLE THE 
PRIVATE SECTOR TO START FILLING THE GAPS IN THE MOTORWAY SERVICE 
AREA NETWORK AND TO INTRODUCE MORE VARIETY. RATHER THAN LARGE, 
INTRUSIVE STATIONS AT LONG INTERVALS WE SHOULD SEE SMALLER, MORE 
FREQUENT SERVICE AREAS PROVIDING A MUCH WIDER RANGE OF 
FACILITIES.  
   WE WILL INVESTIGATE WAYS OF SPEEDING UP, WITHIN THE 
DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORT, THE PROCEDURES FOR BUILDING NEW 
ROADS. WE WILL CONTINUE OUR CAMPAIGN TO KEEP 'CONING OFF' ON 
MOTORWAYS TO A MINIMUM BY EXTENDING LANE RENTAL SCHEMES, 
UNDER WHICH CONTRACTORS WHO FALL BEHIND SCHEDULE INCUR 
FINANCIAL PENALTIES. NEXT YEAR TWO-THIRDS OF ALL MOTORWAY 
MAINTENANCE WORK WILL BE CARRIED OUT IN THIS WAY. BRITAIN HAS 
THE BEST ROAD SAFETY RECORD IN THE EC. IN SPITE OF THE VASTLY 
INCREASED VOLUME OF TRAFFIC, FEWER PEOPLE ARE NOW KILLED ON OUR 
ROADS THAN AT ANY TIME SINCE 1948. OUR AIM IS TO IMPROVE ON 
THAT RECORD STILL FURTHER.   
  IN SPITE OF THE BENEFITS THEY BRING, CARS CARRY AN ENVIRONMENTAL 
COST. IN BRITAIN CATALYTIC CONVERTERS WILL BE COMPULSORY ON ALL 
NEW CARS FROM THE END OF 1992 . THIS WILL ELIMINATE VIRTUALLY ALL 
HARMFUL EXHAUST GASES, EXCEPT FOR THE EMISSION OF CO2. THE 
ONLY CERTAIN WAY OF CUTTING CO2 EMISSIONS IS TO ENCOURAGE FUEL 
EFFICIENCY. ACTION IS NEEDED AT INTERNATIONAL LEVEL AND WE WILL 
PLAY OUR FULL PART. BUSES HAVE AN INCREASINGLY IMPORTANT PART TO 
PLAY THE DEREGULATION OF LONG-DISTANCE COACH SERVICES HAS LED 
TO A MAJOR EXPANSION IN RELIABLE AND CHEAP SERVICES. BUS 
DEREGULATION OUTSIDE LONDON HAS INCREASED MILEAGE BY 16 PER 
CENT. WE NOW PROPOSE TO TAKE DEREGULATION AND PRIVATISATION 
FURTHER. WE WILL IMPROVE ROAD TRANSPORT BY:
 INVESTING £6,300 MILLION IN OUR TRUNK ROAD AND MOTORWAY 
NETWORK OVER THE NEXT THREE YEARS CONCENTRATING PARTICULARLY ON 
BYPASSES. SOME 40 NEW ONES WILL BE OPENED BY 1995 ON TRUNK 
ROADS ALONE.
 INCREASING PENALTIES FOR THOSE CONVICTED OF DRINK DRIVING.
 INSTALLING CAMERAS AT DANGEROUS ROAD JUNCTIONS TO FILM THOSE 
WHO DRIVE THROUGH RED TRAFFIC LIGHTS.
 ENCOURAGING LOCAL COUNCILS, ASSISTED BY A SPECIAL BUDGET WE 
HAVE SET ASIDE, TO INTRODUCE PEDESTRIAN PRIORITY AREAS AND CYCLE 
LANES.
 PRIVATISING THE REMAINING 39 LOCAL AUTHORITY BUS COMPANIES.
 DEREGULATING BUSES IN LONDON AND PRIVATISING THE LONDON 
BUSES SUBSIDIARIES. A NEW LONDON BUS EXECUTIVE WILL BE 
RESPONSIBLE FOR BUS-STOPS, STANDS AND STATIONS AND FOR 
CONTRACTING OUT SOCIALLY NECESSARY SERVICES. THE CONCESSIONARY 
FARES SCHEME IN LONDON WILL CONTINUE.
 CHANGING THE SYSTEM UNDER WHICH MOTORWAY SERVICE AREAS 
ARE PROVIDED.
 ENCOURAGING ACTION INTERNATIONALLY, AND WITHIN OUR OWN 
MOTOR INDUSTRY, TO PROMOTE MORE FUEL EFFICIENT VEHICLES.
 
AVIATION AND SHIPPING

MORE COMPETITION IN AVIATION MEANS MORE CHOICE, BETTER 
SERVICES AND LOWER FARES. THAT IS WHY WE HAVE BEEN PRESSING 
WITHIN THE EC FOR FULL LIBERALISATION OF SERVICES. WE ALSO WANT 
TO SEE MORE TRANSATLANTIC FLIGHTS, PARTICULARLY TO REGIONAL 
AIRPORTS. PEOPLE IN THE REGIONS SHOULD NOT HAVE TO TRAVEL TO 
LONDON IN ORDER TO FLY TO THE UNITED STATES. DIRECT FLIGHTS 
WOULD BOOST LOCAL ECONOMIES AND APPLY DOWNWARD PRESSURE ON 
FARES. THE KEY REGIONAL AIRPORTS ARE STILL IN LOCAL AUTHORITY 
OWNERSHIP. THEY SHOULD BE WELL PLACED TO BENEFIT FROM AN 
INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF DIRECT POINT-TO-POINT FLIGHTS. BUT IF 
THEY ARE REALLY TO GROW AND PROSPER, THEY NEED ACCESS TO PRIVATE 
CAPITAL, FREED FROM THE CONSTRAINTS OF PUBLIC OWNERSHIP. 
    AIR SAFETY CANNOT BE COMPROMISED. OVER THE NEXT FIVE YEARS 
THE CIVIL AVIATION AUTHORITY WILL INVEST £750 MILLION IN 
MODERNISING ITS SYSTEMS.  
   MORE CAN BE DONE TO CUT SOME OF THE REGULATORY BURDENS OUR 
SHIPPING INDUSTRY FACES. WE WILL ENSURE THAT THE 
RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE GOVERNMENT-INDUSTRY JOINT WORKING 
PARTY ARE PUT INTO EFFECT AS RAPIDLY AS POSSIBLE.
 WE WILL FURTHER LIBERALISE TRANSATLANTIC AIR SERVICES AND 
ENCOURAGE MORE INTERNATIONAL FLIGHTS TO AND FROM REGIONAL 
AIRPORTS.
 WE WILL ENCOURAGE LOCAL AUTHORITIES TO SELL THEIR AIRPORTS.
 WE WILL REDUCE AIRPORT CONGESTION BY INCREASING THE CAPACITY 
OF OUR AIR TRAFFIC CONTROL. WE WILL CONTINUE TO CAMPAIGN WITHIN 
THE EC FOR FURTHER LIBERALISATION, PARTICULARLY OF CABOTAGE, SO 
THAT THERE ARE MORE COMMERCIAL OPPORTUNITIES FOR BRITISH 
COMPANIES. 
LONDON'S TRANSPORT

A MAJOR PROGRAMME OF RENEWAL AND MODERNISATION IS 
TRANSFORMING PUBLIC TRANSPORT IN LONDON- INCLUDING THE 
BIGGEST EXPANSION OF LONDON'S RAIL NETWORK SINCE THE 1930S. 
THE £750 MILLION UPGRADING OF THE CENTRAL LINE IS ALREADY 
UNDER WAY, TO BE FOLLOWED BY A SIMILAR PROGRAMME ON THE 
NORTHERN LINE; THE JUBILEE LINE EXTENSION AND CROSSRAIL WILL 
FOLLOW. LONDON UNDERGROUND IS PLANNING TO INVEST £3,500 
MILLION OVER THE NEXT THREE YEARS. IT HAS INTRODUCED AN 
AMBITIOUS COMPANY PLAN WHICH WILL LEAD TO BETTER SERVICE, 
CLEANER TRAINS AND MORE STAFF AT STATIONS AND ON PLATFORMS. THEIR 
NEW CHARTER WILL BE PUBLISHED SHORTLY.  
   RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE DOCKLANDS LIGHT RAILWAY HAS BEEN 
TRANSFERRED TO THE LONDON DOCKLANDS DEVELOPMENT 
CORPORATION. AS ITS PERFORMANCE CONTINUES TO IMPROVE, WE 
EXPECT TO SEE GROWING PRIVATE SECTOR INTEREST IN PURCHASING IT 
OUTRIGHT.
 WE WILL SEEK TO PRIVATISE THE DOCKLANDS LIGHT RAILWAY 
DURING THE LIFETIME OF THE NEXT PARLIAMENT.
 THE NEW JUBILEE LINE IS BEING EXTENDED TO DOCKLANDS AND 
SOUTH EAST LONDON AND WILL BE FOLLOWED BY THE EAST-WEST 
CROSSRAIL, LINKING PADDINGTON TO LIVERPOOL STREET. THE 
DOCKLANDS LIGHT RAILWAY IS BEING EXTENDED AT AN EVENTUAL COST 
OF £800 MILLION.
 LONDON UNDERGROUND'S CHARTER WILL SET OUT TOUGHER NEW 
STANDARDS AND WHAT IT WILL DO TO COMPENSATE PASSENGERS SHOULD 
IT FAIL TO MEET THOSE STANDARDS.
 
LOCAL GOVERNMENT

LOCAL COUNCILLORS-SOME 25,000 MEN AND WOMEN THROUGHOUT 
BRITAIN-ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR SOME OF OUR MOST IMPORTANT PUBLIC 
SERVICES. SINCE 1979 WE HAVE SOUGHT TO CREATE AN ACCOUNTABLE 
LOCAL GOVERNMENT SYSTEM CAPABLE OF DELIVERING HIGH QUALITY 
LOCAL SERVICES AT A PRICE THAT LOCAL PEOPLE ARE PREPARED TO PAY. 
CONSERVATIVES COUNCILS IN SHIRES, DISTRICTS AND CITIES HAVE BEEN 
AT THE FOREFRONT OF THESE REFORMS.  IN A RESPONSIVE AND EFFICIENT 
MANNER, THEY HAVE DEMONSTRATED HOW TO DELIVER GOOD SERVICES 
AT AN AFFORDABLE PRICE. OVER THE PAST 13 YEARS, WE HAVE: 
-HELD DOWN UNJUSTIFIED RISES IN THE COST OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT;
-ABOLISHED THE POWER OF LOCAL COUNCILS TO SHIFT THE BURDEN OF 
TAXATION ON TO LOCAL BUSINESS, FOR THE FIRST TIME LIMITING THE 
OVERALL RISE IN BUSINESS RATES TO NO MORE THAN THE RATE OF 
INFLATION;
 -ABOLISHED AN EXPENSIVE AND BUREAUCRATIC LAYER OF 
GOVERNMENT IN LONDON AND OTHER BIG CITIES;
 -DEVELOPED THE LOCAL AUTHORITY ROLE FROM DIRECT PROVIDER TO 
EFFECTIVE ENABLER, ENCOURAGING MANY TENANTS TO BUY THEIR OWN 
HOMES, ALLOWING SCHOOLS THE FREEDOM TO MANAGE THEIR OWN 
AFFAIRS AND IMPROVING THE QUALITY OF LOCAL SERVICES BY ALLOWING 
PRIVATE BUSINESS TO COMPETE FOR CONTRACTS.  
   LABOUR THREATEN ALL THESE REFORMS. THEY WOULD UNCAP LOCAL 
SPENDING, LEADING TO HIGHER LOCAL AND NATIONAL TAXES. THEY 
WOULD UNCAP BUSINESS RATES, THREATENING A RETURN TO THE 1980S 
WHEN THE ENGLISH RATE POUNDAGE ROSE 37 PER CENT MORE THAN 
INFLATION. THEY WOULD ABOLISH THE REQUIREMENT ON LOCAL 
AUTHORITIES TO SEEK VALUE FOR MONEY THROUGH COMPETITIVE 
TENDERING. THEY WOULD REMOVE THE FREEDOM OF LOCAL 
COMMUNITIES TO PRESERVE THEIR GRAMMAR SCHOOLS. THEY WOULD 
INTRODUCE A NEW EXPENSIVE LAYER OF GOVERNMENT BUREAUCRACY AT 
REGIONAL LEVEL. THEY WOULD RETURN LOCAL GOVERNMENT FINANCE TO 
THE BAD OLD DAYS OF DOMESTIC RATES, WITH UNRESTRAINED POWER FOR 
LOCAL COUNCILS TO CHARGE HOUSEHOLDERS AS MUCH AS THEY LIKE. 
AND THEY WOULD ABOLISH THE AUDIT COMMISSION, WHICH NOT ONLY 
MAINTAINS THE PROBITY OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT ACCOUNTING, BUT ALSO 
PIONEERED THE DRIVE FOR BETTER QUALITY OF SERVICE AND VALUE FOR 
MONEY IN LOCAL GOVERNMENT.   
  WE NOW PROPOSE FURTHER REFORMS IN THE STRUCTURE, FINANCE AND 
ACCOUNTABILITY OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT. IN THE MEANTIME, WE HAVE 
TRANSFERRED A FURTHER SHARE OF THE BURDEN OF FINANCING LOCAL 
SERVICES TO CENTRAL GOVERNMENT. TODAY, LOCAL COMMUNITY 
CHARGEPAYERS BEAR ONLY A SMALL PROPORTION OF THE COST OF LOCAL 
COUNCILS.
 WE WILL SET UP A COMMISSION TO EXAMINE, AREA BY AREA, THE 
APPROPRIATE LOCAL GOVERNMENT ARRANGEMENTS IN ENGLAND. LOCAL 
COMMUNITIES WILL BE FULLY CONSULTED AND THEIR LOYALTIES AND 
INTERESTS WILL BE CENTRAL TO THE COMMISSION'S TASK IN DECIDING 
WHETHER IN ANY AREA A SINGLE TIER OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT COULD 
PROVIDE BETTER ACCOUNTABILITY AND GREATER EFFICIENCY.
 WE ARE LOOKING AT WAYS IN WHICH THE INTERNAL MANAGEMENT OF 
LOCAL AUTHORITIES MIGHT BECOME MORE EFFECTIVE.
 WE ARE APPLYING THE PRINCIPLES OF THE CITIZEN'S CHARTER TO 
LOCAL GOVERNMENT, REQUIRING THE PUBLICATION OF MORE 
INFORMATION WHICH WILL ENABLE LOCAL PEOPLE TO JUDGE THE 
EFFICIENCY OF THEIR COUNCILS IN PROVIDING SERVICES.
 WE WILL CONTINUE TO CAP LOCAL SPENDING WHERE NECESSARY.
 AS WE ANNOUNCED IN THE BUDGET, NO ONE'S UNIFORM BUSINESS 
RATE WILL GO UP THIS YEAR BY MORE THAN THE RATE OF INFLATION-4.1 
PER CENT. AND WE HAVE SPEEDED UP THE BENEFITS OF REVALUATION 
FOR THOSE BUSINESSES WHO GAIN FROM IT.
 IN FUTURE YEARS, WE WILL MAINTAIN OUR PLEDGE TO PREVENT UBR 
POUNDAGE RISING BY MORE THAN INFLATION.
 WE WILL REPLACE THE COMMUNITY CHARGE WITH A NEW COUNCIL 
TAX IN APRIL 1993. THE COUNCIL TAX WILL BE SIMPLE AND 
STRAIGHTFORWARD TO ADMINISTER. IT WILL BE FAIR AND WILL RIGHTLY 
REFLECT BOTH THE VALUE OF THE PROPERTY AND THE NUMBER OF ADULTS 
WHO LIVE IN IT.
 SINGLE HOUSEHOLDERS, WHO SUFFERED UNDER THE RATES, WILL 
RECEIVE A 25 PER CENT DISCOUNT. BY GROUPING PROPERTIES INTO A 
LIMITED NUMBER OF BANDS, THE COUNCIL TAX ALSO AVOIDS THE 
PUNITIVE BILLS WHICH WOULD BE IMPOSED BY AN UNFETTERED RATING 
SYSTEM OF THE KIND PROPOSED BY LABOUR. STUDENTS AND PEOPLE ON 
LOW INCOMES WILL NOT HAVE TO PAY. 

CITIES

WE TAKE PRIDE IN OUR CITIES. RIGHT ACROSS BRITAIN THEY HAVE BEEN 
GIVEN A NEW LEASE OF LIFE. FROM LONDON TO GLASGOW, FROM 
CARDIFF TO NEWCASTLE, HISTORIC BUILDINGS HAVE BEEN RESTORED AND 
AREAS WHICH HAD BEEN RUN DOWN HAVE BEEN TRANSFORMED. THE 
£4,000 MILLION 'ACTION FOR CITIES' PROGRAMME UNDERLINES THE 
CONSERVATIVE COMMITMENT TO OUR INNER CITIES AND THE PEOPLE 
WHO LIVE THERE. IT HIGHLIGHTS OUR DETERMINATION TO SPREAD 
OPPORTUNITY AS WIDELY AS POSSIBLE. WE WANT ALL OUR PEOPLE TO 
SHARE IN GROWING PROSPERITY AND TO HAVE A STAKE IN THE COUNTRY'S 
FUTURE. MUCH HAS BEEN ACHIEVED IN RECENT YEARS. THE URBAN 
DEVELOPMENT CORPORATIONS AND THE WIDE RANGE OF CENTRAL 
GOVERNMENT GRANTS HAVE HELPED TO REGENERATE MANY OF OUR INNER 
CITY AREAS. BUT MORE REMAINS TO BE DONE.  
   THE BEST WAY TO RESTORE THE SPIRIT OF ENTERPRISE WHICH FIRST 
MADE OUR CITIES GREAT IS FOR LOCAL PEOPLE, THE PRIVATE SECTOR, THE 
VOLUNTARY SECTOR AND LOCAL AND CENTRAL GOVERNMENT, TO WORK 
TOGETHER IN PARTNERSHIP. THAT IS THE PRINCIPLE WHICH LIES BEHIND 
CITY CHALLENGE. ITS NEW APPROACH OF COMPETITIVE BIDDING HAS 
ALREADY GALVANISED TOWNS AND CITIES INTO BRINGING FORWARD 
IMAGINATIVE PROPOSALS FOR REGENERATION. IT HAS IMPROVED CO-
ORDINATION, SECURED BETTER VALUE FOR MONEY AND ENCOURAGED 
PROGRAMMES WHICH TACKLE PROBLEMS ON A NUMBER OF FRONTS.
 WE WILL CONTINUE TO EXTEND CITY CHALLENGE AND ALLOCATE A 
GREATER PROPORTION OF RESOURCES BY COMPETITIVE BIDDING.
 WE WILL SUPPORT URBAN DEVELOPMENT CORPORATIONS IN THEIR 
CRITICAL TASK OF URBAN REGENERATION.
 WE WILL BRING TOGETHER RESOURCES FOR TARGETED INNER CITY 
PROGRAMMES INTO A SINGLE BUDGET. THIS WILL MEAN THAT FUNDING 
WILL GO WHERE IT IS MOST NEEDED LOCALLY RATHER THAN ACCORDING TO 
A SET OF PRIORITIES DETERMINED IN WHITEHALL.
 WE WILL STRENGTHEN THE MACHINERY FOR CO-ORDINATION IN THE 
REGIONS. NEW, INTEGRATED REGIONAL OFFICES OF THE APPROPRIATE 
WHITEHALL DEPARTMENTS WILL BE ESTABLISHED SO THAT BUSINESS AND 
LOCAL GOVERNMENT WILL HAVE ONLY ONE PORT OF CALL.
 WE WILL ESTABLISH A NEW URBAN REGENERATION AGENCY TO PULL 
TOGETHER OUR EFFORTS TO CLEAR UP AND DEVELOP DERELICT LAND, 
HELPING TO BRING IT BACK INTO COMMERCIAL USE AND PROVIDE NEW 
OPPORTUNITIES FOR LOCAL PEOPLE.   
  WORKING IN THE URBAN AREAS, THE URA WILL ADMINISTER MUCH OF 
THE URBAN PROGRAMME OF THE DEPARTMENT OF THE ENVIRONMENT. IT 
WILL HAVE A DUAL FUNCTION. FIRST, OUTSIDE THE EXISTING UDC AREAS, 
IT WILL RECLAIM DERELICT LAND, ASSEMBLING SUITABLE SITES FOR 
REDEVELOPMENT USING VESTING OR COMPULSORY PURCHASE POWERS 
WHERE NECESSARY. SECOND, IT WILL ITSELF BE ABLE TO DEVELOP LAND 
IN PARTNERSHIP WITH THE PRIVATE SECTOR. THIS REPRESENTS A MAJOR 
STEP FORWARD IN UNLOCKING THE COMMERCIAL POTENTIAL OF OUR INNER 
CITIES AND OF BREATHING NEW LIFE INTO AREAS WHICH MAY HAVE BEEN 
DERELICT FOR MANY YEARS.  
   BUT OUR FOCUS IS NOT JUST ON PHYSICAL REGENERATION. WE WANT TO 
SEE MORE OPPORTUNITIES FOR TRAINING, MORE ENCOURAGEMENT TO 
ENTERPRISE, BETTER EDUCATION AND MORE MEASURES TO TACKLE DRUGS 
AND CRIME. ENCOURAGING ENTERPRISE, IMPROVING THE ENVIRONMENT 
AND PROVIDING NEW OPPORTUNITIES FOR THE UNEMPLOYED ARE 
CENTRAL TO OUR INNER CITY POLICIES. REMOTIVATING INDIVIDUALS AND 
PROVIDING THE RIGHT CONDITIONS FOR BUSINESS ARE THE ONLY WAYS TO 
MAKE LASTING CHANGE.
 WE WILL OFFER THE LOAN GUARANTEE SCHEME FOR SMALL FIRMS ON 
MORE GENEROUS TERMS IN INNER CITY AREAS. THE SCHEME WILL BE 
EXTENDED FROM TASK FORCE AREAS TO INCLUDE SUCCESSFUL CITY 
CHALLENGE BIDDERS.
 WE WILL MAKE MORE PEOPLE ELIGIBLE FOR OUR SUCCESSFUL JOB 
INTERVIEW GUARANTEE SCHEME, WHICH LINKS UNEMPLOYED PEOPLE 
WITH LOCAL JOBS.
 WE WILL CARRY OUT PILOT PROJECTS FOR THE 'FOYER' CONCEPT, 
WHEREBY YOUNG PEOPLE ARE GIVEN A PLACE IN A HOTEL IF IN 
EXCHANGE THEY GIVE A COMMITMENT TO TRAIN AND LOOK FOR WORK.
 WE WILL PILOT A NUMBER OF 'BACK TO WORK' BONUS SCHEMES IN 
INNER CITY AREAS FOR THE LONG-TERM UNEMPLOYED.
 WE WILL EXTEND CUSTOMISED TRAINING UNDER THE JOB LINK 
PROGRAMME TO INCLUDE CITY CHALLENGE AREAS.
 WE WILL MAKE INNER CITY TASK FORCE AND CITY CHALLENGE AREAS 
ELIGIBLE FOR REGIONAL INNOVATION GRANTS.   
  WE ARE ALSO DETERMINED TO RAISE STANDARDS IN OUR INNER CITY 
SCHOOLS, TO CRACK DOWN ON TRUANCY,AND TO HELP PREPARE YOUNG 
PEOPLE FOR THE WORLD OF WORK. THE CITY TECHNOLOGY COLLEGES 
SHOW WHAT CAN BE DONE. THEY ARE OVERWHELMINGLY POPULAR WITH 
PARENTS AND PUPILS AND ARE DOING MUCH TO RAISE STANDARDS FOR 
CHILDREN OF ALL ABILITIES IN THE INNER CITIES. UNDER THE CITIZEN'S 
CHARTER, WE SHALL SOON BE ABLE TO IDENTIFY MUCH MORE PRECISELY 
THAN EVER BEFORE THOSE SCHOOLS WHICH ARE DELIVERING 
UNACCEPTABLY LOW STANDARDS. SO WILL PARENTS. WE WILL PUBLISH 
TEST RESULTS, EXAM RESULTS AND TRUANCY RATES AND ENSURE THAT THERE 
IS REGULAR INDEPENDENT INSPECTION. THIS WILL ENABLE US TO PUT THE 
SPOTLIGHT ON THOSE INNER CITY LOCAL EDUCATION AUTHORITIES AND 
SCHOOLS WHICH ARE FAILING THEIR PUPILS.
 WE WILL CONTINUE TO SEEK OPPORTUNITIES TO OPEN NEW CTCS IN 
DEPRIVED INNER CITY AREAS.
 WE WILL ENSURE THAT MORE SCHOOLS, ESPECIALLY IN THE INNER 
CITIES, HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO DEVELOP THEIR TECHNOLOGICAL 
EXPERTISE.  
   TACKLING CRIME AND THE FEAR OF CRIME FORMS A VITAL PART OF THE 
STRATEGY TO MAKE OUR INNER CITIES BETTER PLACES TO LIVE AND WORK. 
THE SAFER CITIES INITIATIVE, LAUNCHED IN 1988, HAS SUCCESSFULLY 
BROUGHT TOGETHER LOCAL GROUPS AND AGENCIES TO TACKLE CRIME IN 
SOME OF OUR WORST AFFECTED URBAN AREAS. TWENTY SCHEMES ARE 
ALREADY IN OPERATION.
 WE WILL DOUBLE THE NUMBER OF SAFER CITIES SCHEMES TO COVER 
40 URBAN AREAS. 

LONDON

LONDON IS A MAGNET TO VISITORS AND BUSINESS FROM ACROSS THE 
WORLD. SINCE 1979 WE HAVE INVESTED HEAVILY TO SECURE THAT 
STATUS. BILLIONS OF POUNDS HAVE GONE INTO IMPROVING AIR, RAIL 
AND UNDERGROUND LINKS. WE WILL CONTINUE THAT PROGRAMME OF 
MODERNISATION. WE ARE DETERMINED TO SUSTAIN INTO THE NEXT 
CENTURY LONDON'S SPECIAL POSITION AS ONE OF THE WORLD'S LEADING 
CAPITAL CITIES. WE REJECT LABOUR'S PLAN TO RECREATE A BUREAUCRATIC 
AND WASTEFUL GLC. INSTEAD, AS PART OF OUR MILLENNIUM 
PROGRAMME, WE WILL LAUNCH A LONDON 2000 INITIATIVE. THE 
SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE ENVIRONMENT WILL CONVENE A NEW 
PRIVATE SECTOR FORUM TO PROMOTE LONDON INTERNATIONALLY AS A 
BUSINESS, TOURIST AND CULTURAL CENTRE.  
   THE SECRETARY OF STATE WILL ALSO CHAIR A NEW CABINET SUB-
COMMITTEE TO BRING TOGETHER MINISTERS FROM ALL KEY DEPARTMENTS 
AND CO-ORDINATE POLICY FOR THE FURTHER IMPROVEMENT OF LONDON. 
A SINGLE MINISTER WILL BE GIVEN RESPONSIBILITY FOR CO-ORDINATING 
LONDON'S TRANSPORT SERVICES. LONDON'S PLACE AS A WORLD CENTRE 
FOR FINANCIAL AND INSURANCE SERVICES IS PRE-EMINENT; WE INTEND 
TO KEEP IT THAT WAY. AND WE WILL SUPPORT THE VIGOROUS CULTURAL 
LIFE OF THE CAPITAL, WHICH HAS SEEN NEW GALLERIES, THEATRES AND 
MUSEUMS OPENING OVER THE LAST DECADE.
 WE WILL LAUNCH A LONDON 2000 INITIATIVE.
   WE WILL CONVENE A NEW PRIVATE SECTOR FORUM TO PROMOTE 
LONDON'S POSITION INTERNATIONALLY.
 WE WILL ESTABLISH A NEW CABINET SUBCOMMITTEE TO COORDINATE 
POLICY ON LONDON.
 WE WILL GIVE A SINGLE TRANSPORT MINISTER RESPONSIBILITY FOR 
SERVICES IN LONDON. HE WILL CHAIR A NEW TRANSPORT WORKING 
GROUP WHICH WILL BRING TOGETHER PUBLIC TRANSPORT OPERATORS-
FROM BOTH PUBLIC AND PRIVATE SECTORS-TO DISCUSS TRANSPORT 
ISSUES IN LONDON. 

THE COUNTRYSIDE

WE HAVE ALWAYS CARED FOR THE COUNTRYSIDE. WE SUPPORT ITS 
MAJOR INDUSTRIES AND WAY OF LIFE, WHILE RECOGNISING THE PLACE IT 
HOLDS IN THE HEARTS OF THOSE WHO LIVE IN TOWNS. WE WANT TO 
PROTECT OUR MOST BEAUTIFUL LANDSCAPES, CONSERVE THE ABUNDANCE 
AND VARIETY OF OUR WILDLIFE AND HABITATS, PROMOTE ACCESS AND 
PUBLIC ENJOYMENT OF THE COUNTRYSIDE, AND ENCOURAGE PUBLIC 
PARTICIPATION IN CARING FOR THE COUNTRYSIDE.  
   BUT THE COUNTRYSIDE IS MORE THAN JUST A PRETTY PICTURE. IT IS A 
PLACE WHERE PEOPLE LIVE AND WORK, AS THEY HAVE DONE IN THE PAST 
AND WILL DO IN THE FUTURE. IN PROVIDING OUR PUBLIC SERVICES, WE 
WILL CONTINUE TO RECOGNISE THE PARTICULAR NEEDS OF PEOPLE WHO 
LIVE IN THE COUNTRYSIDE. WE WILL CONTINUE TO PROMOTE A DIVERSE 
RURAL ECONOMY, BALANCING THE NEED FOR JOBS, HOUSING AND 
SERVICES IN RURAL AREAS WITH PROTECTION OF THE RURAL ENVIRONMENT. 

AGRICULTURE

CENTURIES OF FARMING HAVE SHAPED OUR COUNTRYSIDE. NOW 
FARMING IS AT A CROSSROADS, BOTH HERE AND IN THE REST OF THE 
EUROPEAN COMMUNITY. WORLD-WIDE PRESSURE TO REDUCE 
PROTECTIONIST MEASURES, AND THE NEED TO CONTAIN THE COST OF THE 
COMMON AGRICULTURAL POLICY, MEAN THAT FARMERS WILL FACE 
REDUCED SUPPORT AND INCREASED COMPETITION. WE BELIEVE THAT 
FARMING IN THE UK CAN MEET THESE CHALLENGES. BUT MANY 
FARMERS WILL NEED HELP TO ADAPT TO THE NEW CONDITIONS, AND WE 
WILL CONTINUE TO PROVIDE ASSISTANCE. IT WILL BECOME INCREASINGLY 
IMPORTANT FOR FARMERS TO OBTAIN A GREATER PROPORTION OF THEIR 
INCOME FROM THE MARKET. WE WILL ENCOURAGE FARMERS, RETAILERS 
AND MANUFACTURERS TO WORK TOGETHER TO INCREASE OUR SHARE OF THE 
EUROPEAN FOOD MARKET.  
   WE ARE COMMITTED TO REDUCING THE BURDEN OF REGULATION ON 
BUSINESS IN GENERAL, AND FARMING IN PARTICULAR. WE WILL NOT 
ACCEPT UK FARMERS BEING PUT AT A DISADVANTAGE BY EC LAWS 
BEING APPLIED DIFFERENTLY IN OTHER COUNTRIES. RESPONSIBLE 
FARMERS HAVE ALWAYS COMBINED EFFICIENT FARMING WITH CARE FOR 
THE COUNTRYSIDE. WE WILL CONTINUE TO ENCOURAGE THIS APPROACH 
THROUGH SCHEMES TO PROTECT LANDSCAPE AND HABITATS OF SPECIAL 
IMPORTANCE. WE WILL ALSO MAINTAIN DIRECT SUPPORT FOR FARMING IN 
THE LESS FAVOURED AREAS IN WAYS WHICH ENCOURAGE GOOD 
ENVIRONMENTAL PRACTICE.
 WE WILL SEEK A REFORM OF THE CAP WHICH BRINGS AGRICULTURE 
CLOSER TO THE MARKET, REDUCES THE COSTS TO TAXPAYERS AND 
CONSUMERS; IS IMPLEMENTED AT A PACE WHICH THE INDUSTRY CAN 
BEAR; AFFECTS ALL COMMUNITY FARMERS EQUITABLY, REGARDLESS OF 
SIZE OR LOCATION; AND RECOGNISES THE IMPORTANCE OF 
ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION.
 WE WILL BUILD ON THE PRODUCER MARKETING INITIATIVES WHICH WE 
HAVE ALREADY LAUNCHED, INCLUDING THE GROUP MARKETING GRANT.
 WE WILL ASSIST THE MILK MARKETING BOARD'S MOVE TO A NEW 
STRUCTURE WHICH WILL BE BETTER ABLE TO PROTECT THE INTEREST OF 
PRODUCERS AND CONSUMERS IN THE SINGLE MARKET.
 WE WILL PUBLISH TARGET RESPONSE TIMES FOR GRANT AND LICENCE 
APPLICATIONS MADE TO THE MINISTRY OF AGRICULTURE.
 WE WILL TAKE FORWARD PROPOSALS FOR RADICAL LIBERALISATION OF 
THE AGRICULTURAL TENANCY LAWS IN ORDER TO MAKE MORE LAND 
AVAILABLE FOR RENT, ESPECIALLY FOR NEW ENTRANTS.
 WE WILL ENFORCE EFFECTIVE POLLUTION CONTROL REGULATIONS WHILE 
HELPING FARMERS TO MEET THE HIGH STANDARDS REQUIRED.
 WE WILL PRESS FOR AN AGREEMENT IN THE EC'S AGRICULTURAL 
COUNCIL WHICH WILL ALLOW US TO PROVIDE FINANCIAL ENCOURAGEMENT 
FOR ORGANIC AGRICULTURE. 

FORESTRY

FORESTRY IS A TRADITIONAL RURAL INDUSTRY, WHICH ALSO AFFECTS THE 
LANDSCAPE, AND GIVES PLEASURE TO MILLIONS OF PEOPLE. THE NEEDS 
OF A SUCCESSFUL INDUSTRY, LANDSCAPE CONSERVATION, AND PUBLIC 
ACCESS MUST ALL BE ACCOMMODATED; AND WE WILL REORGANISE THE 
FORESTRY COMMISSION TO REFLECT THESE OBJECTIVES MORE 
EFFECTIVELY.
 WE WILL PLANT A NEW NATIONAL FOREST IN THE MIDLANDS AND 
COMMUNITY FORESTS ELSEWHERE. WE WILL REVIEW THE 
EFFECTIVENESS OF THE CURRENT INCENTIVES FOR FORESTRY INVESTMENT.
 WE WILL PRODUCE GUIDANCE ON THE PREPARATION OF LOCAL 
INDICATIVE FORESTRY STRATEGIES DESIGNED TO ENCOURAGE NEW 
WOODLANDS, WHILE STEERING PLANTING AWAY FROM SENSITIVE AREAS.
 
FISHING

FISHING IS A VITAL INDUSTRY IN MANY PARTS OF OUR ISLANDS. MANY 
FISHERMEN HAVE DONE WELL IN RECENT YEARS BUT THEY NOW FACE 
GREAT PRESSURE ON THE FISH STOCKS. THIS MEANS THAT FISHING QUOTAS 
ARE LIKELY TO FALL IN COMING YEARS IN ORDER TO PRESERVE THE LONG-
TERM FUTURE OF THE FISHERIES. WE WILL CONTINUE TO WORK FOR THE 
PROFITABLE AND SUSTAINABLE FUTURE OF OUR FISHING FLEET.
 WE ARE DETERMINED TO SEE THAT THE RENEGOTIATION OF THE 
COMMON FISHERIES POLICY PROTECTS THE INTERESTS OF UK 
FISHERMAN AND RETAINS OUR SHARE OF THE COMMUNITY'S FISHING 
OPPORTUNITIES. 
 WE WILL INTRODUCE A BALANCED PACKAGE OF MEASURES, INCLUDING 
DECOMMISSIONING AND CONTROLS ON FISHING ACTIVITY, TO CONSERVE 
FISH AND SAFEGUARD THE FUTURE OF THE INDUSTRY. 

RURAL JOBS AND SERVICES

CHANGES IN AGRICULTURE AND OTHER TRADITIONAL INDUSTRIES WILL 
AFFECT EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITIES IN THE COUNTRYSIDE. WE WILL 
CONTINUE TO TARGET HELP THROUGH THE RURAL DEVELOPMENT 
COMMISSION, AND ASK THE RDC TO REVIEW THE RURAL DEVELOPMENT 
AREAS TO ENSURE THAT ITS EFFORTS ARE TARGETED ON THE AREAS OF MOST 
NEED. WE ARE COMMITTED TO DEVELOPING TOURISM IN WAYS WHICH 
PROVIDE ALL-YEAR-ROUND JOBS AND BRING BENEFIT TO LESS WELL-
KNOWN PARTS OF OUR COUNTRYSIDE, WITHOUT DAMAGING THE 
ENVIRONMENT. WE HAVE RECENTLY PUBLISHED NEW PLANNING POLICY 
GUIDANCE WHICH MAKES IT CLEAR HOW THE COUNTRYSIDE CAN BENEFIT 
FROM NEW BUSINESSES AND JOBS, IF THE LOCATION AND DESIGN OF 
DEVELOPMENT ARE HANDLED WITH SENSITIVITY.  
   IN LOCAL GOVERNMENT, MANY OF OUR SHIRE COUNTIES AND DISTRICTS 
HAVE LED THE WAY IN RAISING THE QUALITY OF PUBLIC SERVICE. LOCAL 
POST OFFICES, LOCAL TRANSPORT AND LOCAL SCHOOLS ALL HAVE AN 
IMPORTANT ROLE TO PLAY IN SUSTAINING RURAL LIFE.
 WE WILL CONSULT ON OUR RECENTLY PUBLISHED DRAFT PLANNING 
POLICY GUIDANCE DESIGNED TO PROVIDE A CLEAR FRAMEWORK FOR 
DECISIONS ON DEVELOPMENTS TO AID TOURISM.
 WE WILL WIDEN THE AVAILABILITY OF THE RURAL DEVELOPMENT 
COMMISSION'S SUCCESSFUL REDUNDANT BUILDINGS GRANT SCHEME, AND 
STRENGTHEN OTHER RDC PROGRAMMES.
 WE WILL MAINTAIN OUR SPECIAL PROGRAMMES TO PROMOTE 
AFFORDABLE HOMES IN RURAL AREAS. WE ARE FULLY COMMITTED TO 
MAINTAINING A NATIONAL NETWORK OF POST OFFICES.
 WE WILL CONTINUE TO ASSIST LOCAL AUTHORITIES WHO WANT TO 
SUBSIDISE RURAL TRANSPORT.
 WE WILL ENABLE VILLAGE SCHOOLS THAT WISH TO APPLY FOR GRANT 
MAINTAINED STATUS TO DO SO IN SMALL GROUPS, THUS ENABLING THEM 
TO SHARE MANAGEMENT TASKS WHILE STILL ENJOYING THE BENEFITS OF 
INDEPENDENCE.
 THE EXPANSION OF GP FUND-HOLDING WILL BRING PARTICULAR 
BENEFITS TO RURAL AREAS BECAUSE OF THE CONVENIENCE OF DIFFERENT 
SERVICES-SUCH AS PHYSIOTHERAPY AND CONSULTANT 
APPOINTMENTS-BEING OFFERED IN THE GP'S SURGERY. 

CARING FOR THE COUNTRYSIDE

SOME OF OUR FINEST LANDSCAPES ARE DESIGNATED AS NATIONAL PARKS. 
ALL NATIONAL PARK AUTHORITIES WILL BECOME INDEPENDENT BOARDS, 
WHICH WILL MAKE IT EASIER FOR THEM TO CARRY OUT THEIR TASKS 
EFFECTIVELY. THE NEW FOREST WILL BE GIVEN A STATUTORY STATUS 
WHICH WILL GIVE IT AS GREAT A LEVEL OF PROTECTION AS ANY NATIONAL 
PARK. LAST SUMMER THE GOVERNMENT LAUNCHED AN EXPERIMENT IN 
'COUNTRYSIDE STEWARDSHIP'. THIS AIMS TO CONSERVE, ENHANCE AND 
RE-CREATE FINE LANDSCAPES SO THAT THEY MAY BE ENJOYED AND 
APPRECIATED BY THE PUBLIC. THE RESPONSE FROM FARMERS, 
LANDOWNERS AND ENVIRONMENTAL BODIES HAS BEEN VERY POSITIVE. 
WE THEREFORE PROPOSE TO EXPAND THE SCHEME AND TO INTRODUCE A 
NEW SCHEME TO PRESERVE HEDGEROWS-A MUCH VALUED FEATURE OF 
THE ENGLISH LANDSCAPE, AND A HAVEN FOR WILDLIFE. 
    THE GOVERNMENT ENDORSED AND SUPPORTED THE COUNTRYSIDE 
COMMISSION'S TARGET DESIGNED TO BRING 120,000 MILES OF RIGHTS 
OF WAY INTO GOOD ORDER BY THE END OF THE CENTURY. AT PARISH 
LEVEL, INDIVIDUALS CAN WORK TOGETHER EITHER TO SAFEGUARD THE 
CHARACTER OF THEIR LOCAL VILLAGE, OR TO IMPROVE ITS APPEARANCE. 
LOCAL ACTION CAN ALSO PRESERVE LOCAL WILDLIFE AND HABITATS. 
UNDER THE RURAL ENVIRONMENTAL ACTION SCHEME, GRANTS OF UP TO 
~2,000 PER PROJECT WILL BE AVAILABLE TO SUPPORT LOCAL 
ENVIRONMENTAL ACTION.  
   THE GOVERNMENT IS KEEN TO PROMOTE THE FULLEST POSSIBLE USE OF 
INLAND WATERWAYS FOR LEISURE, RECREATION AND AMENITY, IN THE 
REGENERATION OF INNER CITIES AND FOR FREIGHT TRANSPORT WHERE 
APPROPRIATE. BUT WE RECOGNISE THAT THE VARIOUS USES OF CANALS 
AND RIVERS MUST BE PROPERLY MANAGED TO PROTECT THE CHARACTER 
AND ENVIRONMENT OF THE WATERWAYS.
 WE WILL EXPAND THE COUNTRYSIDE STEWARDSHIP SCHEME TO COVER 
THE CONSERVATION OF HISTORIC LANDSCAPES, MEADOWS, PASTURE AND 
HEDGEROWS. PUBLIC ACCESS TO QUALIFYING SCHEMES WILL BE 
ENCOURAGED.
 WE WILL INTRODUCE A HEDGEROW INCENTIVE SCHEME TO HELP 
PRESERVE HEDGEROWS OF PARTICULAR HISTORIC, LANDSCAPE OR WILDLIFE 
IMPORTANCE.
 WE WILL CONTRIBUTE TO THE COUNTRYSIDE COMMISSION'S 'NEW 
PARISH PATH PARTNERSHIP' DESIGNED TO STIMULATE LOCAL 
MAINTENANCE AND IMPROVEMENT SCHEMES.
 WE WILL CONTINUE TO SUPPORT THE DEVELOPMENT AND 
REDEVELOPMENT OF OUR CANALS, AS WELL AS ENHANCING THE 
ENVIRONMENTAL STANDARDS OF OUR WATERWAYS

THE ENVIRONMENT

THE CONSERVATIVE PARTY'S COMMITMENT TO THE ENVIRONMENT IS 
BEYOND DOUBT. OTHER PARTIES PROMISE THE EARTH. WE HAVE TAKEN 
ACTION - BOTH NATIONALLY AND INTERNATIONALLY- TO PRESERVE IT. 
ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION CAN IMPOSE FINANCIAL COSTS ON 
PRODUCERS, CONSUMERS AND TAXPAYERS, SO WE MUST MAKE SURE THE 
THREAT OF DAMAGE IS A REAL ONE. BUT WE ALSO ACCEPT THE 
PRECAUTIONARY PRINCIPLE-THE NEED TO ACT, WHERE THERE IS 
SIGNIFICANT RISK OF DAMAGE, BEFORE THE SCIENTIFIC EVIDENCE IS 
CONCLUSIVE. AND WE RECOGNISE THAT HIGHER ENVIRONMENTAL 
STANDARDS CAN OFFER NEW OPPORTUNITIES FOR BUSINESS. WE 
PUBLISHED THE FIRST COMPREHENSIVE WHITE PAPER ON THE 
ENVIRONMENT IN 1990. IT COVERED EVERYTHING FROM THE 
STRATOSPHERE TO THE STREET CORNER. WE WILL CONTINUE TO PUBLISH 
ANNUAL PROGRESS REPORTS.  
   THIS CONSERVATIVE GOVERNMENT HAS TAKEN A LEAD IN WORKING TO 
PROTECT THE OZONE LAYER. WE WILL STRIVE TO ACCELERATE THE 
ERADICATION OF OZONE DEPLETING SUBSTANCES. ONE OF THE MOST 
IMPORTANT ISSUES FACING ALL COUNTRIES IS THE THREAT OF GLOBAL 
WARMING. EFFECTIVE ACTION TO COMBAT GLOBAL WARMING MUST BE 
INTERNATIONAL ACTION. AGAIN WE HAVE TAKEN A LEAD. THE PRIME 
MINISTER WAS THE FIRST WORLD LEADER TO ANNOUNCE HIS INTENTION TO 
ATTEND THE EARTH SUMMIT IN RIO DE JANEIRO THIS JUNE. WE HAVE 
SAID THAT WE WILL CONSIDER STABILISING OUR CO2 EMISSIONS EARLIER 
THAN OUR EXISTING CONDITIONAL TARGET OF 2005. WE HAVE PROMISED 
TO PROVIDE NEW AND ADDITIONAL RESOURCES TO HELP THE DEVELOPING 
COUNTRIES TO TACKLE THEIR ENVIRONMENTAL PROBLEMS.   
  WITHIN BRITAIN, AND AHEAD OF OTHER EUROPEAN COUNTRIES, WE 
HAVE INTRODUCED THE CONCEPT OF INTEGRATED POLLUTION CONTROL. WE 
HAVE SET UP, FOR THE FIRST TIME, POWERFUL COORDINATING MACHINERY 
WITHIN WHITEHALL TO ENSURE THAT ENVIRONMENTAL CONSIDERATIONS 
ARE GIVEN DUE WEIGHT IN ALL DECISION MAKING. WE ARE COMMITTED 
TO OPENNESS ON ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS. WE SUPPORT THE 
ESTABLISHMENT OF A EUROPEAN ENVIRONMENT AGENCY TO PROVIDE A 
EUROPE-WIDE ENVIRONMENTAL DATABASE. WE BELIEVE THAT THE 
PUBLIC SHOULD HAVE ACCESS TO INFORMATION HELD BY THE POLLUTION 
CONTROL AUTHORITIES. PUBLIC REGISTERS ARE NOW PROVIDED BY BODIES 
SUCH AS THE NATIONAL RIVERS AUTHORITY AND HER MAJESTY'S 
INSPECTORATE OF POLLUTION.
 WE WILL ESTABLISH A NEW ENVIRONMENT AGENCY WHICH WILL 
BRING TOGETHER THE FUNCTIONS OF THE NATIONAL RIVERS AUTHORITY, 
HER MAJESTY'S INSPECTORATE OF POLLUTION AND THE WASTE 
REGULATION FUNCTIONS OF LOCAL AUTHORITIES.
 THE NEW EA WILL HAVE A STATUTORY DUTY TO PUBLISH AN ANNUAL 
STATE OF THE ENVIRONMENT REPORT.
 WITHIN THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITY WE WILL PRESS FOR THE 
INTRODUCTION OF INTEGRATED POLLUTION CONTROL ON THE UK MODEL. 

TOWARDS THE MILLENNIUM

A MORE PROSPEROUS BRITAIN CAN AFFORD TO BE AMBITIOUS. WE CAN 
ASPIRE TO EXCELLENCE IN THE ARTS, BROADCASTING AND SPORT. WE CAN 
USE OUR INCREASED LEISURE TIME, ENERGY AND MONEY, TO IMPROVE 
LIFE FOR OURSELVES AND OUR FAMILIES. THE NATIONAL LOTTERY WE 
PROPOSE TO INTRODUCE CAN BE USED TO RESTORE OUR HERITAGE AND 
PROMOTE PROJECTS WHICH WILL BECOME A SOURCE OF NATIONAL PRIDE. 
NATIONAL LOTTERIES HAVE BEEN FOUND USEFUL AT SEVERAL TIMES IN 
OUR HISTORY. THE BRITISH MUSEUM WAS FOUNDED OUT OF THE 
PROCEEDS OF SUCH A LOTTERY. FOURTEEN YEARS AGO, A ROYAL 
COMMISSION RECOMMENDED THE CREATION OF A NATIONAL LOTTERY IN 
BRITAIN TO PROVIDE EXTRA MONEY FOR DESERVING CAUSES. THE CASE 
HAS BECOME EVEN STRONGER AS BRITISH PEOPLE GAIN MORE 
OPPORTUNITIES TO PARTICIPATE IN FOREIGN LOTTERIES-THUS INCREASING 
THE RISK THAT FUNDS WHICH WE COULD PUT TO GOOD USE IN BRITAIN 
WILL BE DIVERTED ABROAD.   
  WE BELIEVE A WELL-RUN, CAREFULLY CONTROLLED FORM OF NATIONAL 
LOTTERY WOULD BE POPULAR, WHILE RAISING MONEY FOR MANY GOOD 
CAUSES. WE WILL CANVASS VIEWS ON HOW SUCH A LOTTERY SHOULD BE 
RUN AND CONTROLLED, AND HOW IT WOULD FIT WITHIN THE PATTERN OF 
CHARITABLE FUND-RAISING IN BRITAIN. WE BELIEVE THAT THE FUNDS 
GENERATED BY A NATIONAL LOTTERY SHOULD BE USED TO ENHANCE THE 
LIFE OF OUR NATION. PEOPLE WHO ENJOY THE ARTS, SPORT, BRITAIN'S 
HERITAGE AND FINE COUNTRYSIDE COULD ALL BENEFIT FROM THE 
PROCEEDS FROM A NATIONAL LOTTERY. CHARITIES, RIGHT ACROSS THE 
COUNTRY AND COVERING SUCH AREAS AS MEDICAL RESEARCH, WILL ALSO 
BE POTENTIAL BENEFICIARIES.
 
THE MILLENNIUM FUND

WE WILL BE CONSULTING WIDELY ON THE BEST WAY TO DISTRIBUTE THE 
PROCEEDS OF A LOTTERY. BUT WE HAVE DECIDED THAT PART OF THE 
PROCEEDS SHOULD BE PUT ASIDE, YEAR BY YEAR, INTO A MILLENNIUM 
FUND SPECIFICALLY DEDICATED TO PROJECTS WHICH WILL 
COMMEMORATE THE START OF THE TWENTY-FIRST CENTURY AND WILL BE 
ENJOYED BY FUTURE GENERATIONS.
 WE THEREFORE PROPOSE TO INTRODUCE A NATIONAL LOTTERY FROM 
1994, WHICH WOULD HELP PROVIDE FUNDS FOR A NUMBER OF GOOD 
CAUSES IN THE ARTISTIC, SPORTING, HERITAGE AND CHARITABLE FIELDS-
AND FROM WHICH SOME FUNDS WOULD BE PUT ASIDE FOR A 
MILLENNIUM FUND. THE MILLENNIUM FUND COULD BE USED, FOR 
EXAMPLE:
 TO RESTORE THE FABRIC OF OUR NATION: OUR GREAT INHERITANCE OF 
BUILDINGS WHICH SYMBOLISE AND ENRICH OUR NATIONAL LIFE.
 TO HELP ENDOW OUR CITIES AND REGIONS WITH FACILITIES TO 
ENHANCE THE CELEBRATION OF UNITED KINGDOM 2000, SUCH AS THE 
SPORTING FACILITIES MANCHESTER WOULD NEED TO HOST THE 2000 
OLYMPICS.
 TO HELP ANOTHER MAJOR CITY-CHOSEN BY COMPETITION-TO HOLD 
AN INTERNATIONAL TRADE FAIR DESIGNED TO BE A SHOWCASE OF BRITISH 
INNOVATION FOR THE TWENTY-FIRST CENTURY.
 TO ENABLE VOLUNTARY GROUPS AND LOCAL COMMUNITIES TO BID FOR 
FUNDING FOR THEIR OWN MILLENNIUM PROJECTS FOR LOCAL RESTORATION 
SCHEMES, OR FOR IMPROVING THE AMENITIES OF CANALS AND RIVERS, AS 
A SOURCE OF ENJOYMENT FOR LOCAL PEOPLE AND A HABITAT FOR 
WILDLIFE.
 TO PROVIDE MILLENNIUM BURSARIES FOR YOUNG PEOPLE (AND 
NEWLY RETIRED PEOPLE) OFFERING THEIR TIME, ENERGY AND 
COMMITMENT TO SCHEMES DESIGNED TO CHANGE THE FACE OF THE 
UNITED KINGDOM BY THE YEAR 2000. 

THE ARTS

BRITAIN HAS A GREAT ARTISTIC HERITAGE AND A LIVELY CONTEMPORARY 
ARTS SCENE. THE ARTS HAVE FLOURISHED IN RECENT YEARS, WITH 
GROWING ATTENDANCE AT THEATRE, OPERA, DANCE AND ARTS FESTIVALS. 
WE HAVE SUPPORTED THIS BY INCREASING THE PUBLIC FUNDING OF THE 
ARTS, BY 60 PER CENT IN REAL TERMS SINCE 1979, AND INTRODUCING 
NEW INCENTIVES TO PERSONAL GIVING. THE ARTS HAVE ALSO FORGED 
NEW PARTNERSHIPS WITH LOCAL AUTHORITIES, BUSINESSES AND PRIVATE 
PATRONS. BUSINESS SPONSORSHIP IN PARTICULAR HAS EXPANDED 
HUGELY.  
   WE HAVE SET UP NEW REGIONAL ARTS BOARDS AND SUPPORTED THE 
SCOTTISH AND WELSH ARTS COUNCILS IN ORDER TO DIVERSIFY AND 
ENRICH CULTURAL LIFE THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY. WE HAVE FINANCED 
THE EUROPEAN ARTS FESTIVAL TO BE HELD THROUGHOUT BRITAIN DURING 
OUR PRESIDENCY OF THE COMMUNITY IN THE SECOND HALF OF THIS 
YEAR, AS WELL AS THE FIRST NATIONAL MUSIC DAY IN JUNE. IN THIS 
YEAR'S BUDGET, WE ANNOUNCED FURTHER TAX RELIEF ON FILM-MAKING 
IN THIS COUNTRY. OUR AIM IS TO MAKE THE PERFORMING ARTS, 
MUSEUMS AND OUR HERITAGE ACCESSIBLE TO ALL. WE WILL ENCOURAGE 
THE YOUNG TO BECOME INVOLVED AND WILL FACILITATE ACCESS FOR THE 
DISABLED.
 THE NATIONAL LOTTERY WILL PROVIDE A NEW SOURCE OF FINANCE FOR 
THE ARTS.
 WE WILL MAINTAIN SUPPORT FOR THE ARTS AND CONTINUE TO DEVELOP 
SCHEMES FOR GREATER SPONSORSHIP IN CO-OPERATION WITH BUSINESS 
AND PRIVATE INDIVIDUALS.
 WE WILL RE-EXAMINE THE ROLE OF THE ARTS COUNCIL, AS MANY OF 
ITS FUNCTIONS ARE NOW CARRIED OUT REGIONALLY.
 WE WILL CONTINUE OUR SUPPORT OF LIBRARIES AS EDUCATIONAL, 
CULTURAL AND COMMUNITY CENTRES, AND URGE LOCAL AUTHORITIES TO 
KEEP UP STANDARDS. WE WILL COMPLETE THE NEW BRITISH LIBRARY 
BUILDING FOR WHICH WE HAVE PROVIDED £450 MILLION. 

SPORT

SUCCESS IN SPORT IS A SOURCE OF NATIONAL PRIDE. ENJOYMENT OF 
SPORT CAN ENRICH EVERY LIFE. WE HAVE GIVEN STRONG SUPPORT TO THE 
SPORTS COUNCIL AND ITS EFFORTS TO RAISE PARTICIPATION IN SPORT. WE 
ACTIVELY SUPPORT MANCHESTER'S BID TO BRING THE OLYMPIC GAMES 
TO BRITAIN. WE WANT TO RESTORE THE GOOD IMAGE OF FOOTBALL. 
TOUGH ACTION HAS CUT DOWN FOOTBALL HOOLIGANISM. WE HAVE 
HELPED TO ESTABLISH THE FOOTBALL TRUST, WHICH NOW DEVOTES £20 
MILLION A YEAR TO IMPROVING THE SAFETY OF GROUNDS.   
  UNDER THE NATIONAL CURRICULUM ALL PRIMARY AND SECONDARY AGE 
PUPILS WILL FOLLOW A COURSE OF PE . ALL PUPILS WILL BE TAUGHT TO 
SWIM BY THE AGE OF 11.  
   WE WILL CONTINUE TO ENCOURAGE PRIVATE SECTOR SPONSORSHIP OF 
SPORT. WE WILL ENCOURAGE MORE EFFECTIVE USE OF LOCAL SPORT AND 
LEISURE FACILITIES THROUGH COMPULSORY COMPETITIVE TENDERING. 
WE WANT TO SEE MORE DUAL USE OF SCHOOL PLAYING FIELDS AND HALLS 
AND WILL GIVE SCHOOLS MORE FREEDOM IN THEIR MANAGEMENT. WE 
ARE ASKING LOCAL EDUCATION AUTHORITIES NOT TO MAKE SALES OF 
SCHOOL PLAYING FIELDS IN FUTURE UNLESS THERE IS NO EVIDENCE OF 
LONG-TERM NEED.
 SPORT, TOO, WILL BENEFIT FROM THE RESOURCES GENERATED BY THE 
NATIONAL LOTTERY.
 WE WILL ACTIVELY SUPPORT BRITAIN'S BID TO HOST THE 2000 
OLYMPIC GAMES IN MANCHESTER. WE WILL PROVIDE £55 MILLION 
TOWARDS THE PREPARATION OF THE SITE AND KEY FACILITIES IN THE FIRST 
STAGE OF THE BID, AND WE WILL ENSURE THAT THE PROJECT, WHETHER 
SUCCESSFUL OR NOT, CONTRIBUTES TO THE EFFECTIVE REGENERATION OF 
EAST MANCHESTER.
 WE WILL SET UP A NEW BUSINESS SPONSORSHIP FOR SPORT SCHEME. 
THIS IS EXPECTED TO RAISE £6 MILLION IN ITS FIRST YEAR TO SUPPORT 
LOCAL AND YOUTH SPORT. 

OUR HERITAGE

PUBLIC INTEREST AND INVOLVEMENT IN BRITAIN'S HERITAGE HAS NEVER 
BEEN GREATER. WE HAVE CREATED IN THE PAST DECADE ENGLISH 
HERITAGE AND THE NATIONAL HERITAGE MEMORIAL FUND TO GIVE 
GREATER FOCUS AND DRIVE TO THE GOVERNMENT'S POLICIES. THE 
NATIONAL TRUST AND PRIVATE OWNERS TAKE A LEADING PART IN 
PRESERVING OUR ALMOST UNRIVALLED HERITAGE. GOVERNMENT WILL 
WORK IN PARTNERSHIP TO SECURE OUR HERITAGE FOR THE BENEFIT OF 
FUTURE GENERATIONS.   
  OUR CATHEDRALS ARE AMONG OUR NATIONAL GLORIES. WE THEREFORE 
LAUNCHED THE CATHEDRAL REPAIR GRANT SCHEME IN APRIL 1991, 
PROVIDING £11.5 MILLION OVER THREE YEARS.  
   WE HAVE INCREASED, TO £12 MILLION, THE GRANT TO THE NHMF 
FOR THE PURCHASE OF HISTORIC PROPERTIES, OBJECTS AND COLLECTIONS. 
THE GOVERNMENT ALSO PROVIDES HELP TO PRIVATE OWNERS THROUGH 
ENGLISH HERITAGE REPAIR GRANTS, AND TAX RELIEF IN RETURN FOR 
COMMITMENTS ON UPKEEP AND PUBLIC ACCESS. WE WANT TO 
PRESERVE THE SPECIAL CHARACTER OF OUR OLD TOWN AND CITY CENTRES. 
WE WILL ENCOURAGE COUNCILS TO ENSURE THAT NEW DEVELOPMENTS 
ARE IN CHARACTER WITH THE PAST; TO MAINTAIN BUILDINGS OF 
IMPORTANCE TO THE CHARACTER OF TOWNS AND CITIES; TO LIMIT 
UNNECESSARY STREET FURNITURE AND SIGNS; AND TO PLANT TREES AND 
PRESERVE HISTORIC PATTERNS AND OPEN SPACES.
 THE NATIONAL LOTTERY WILL ALSO PROVIDE FUNDS FOR THE 
PRESERVATION OF OUR HERITAGE.
 WE WILL CONTINUE TO PROVIDE SUBSTANTIAL FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE 
FOR THE PROTECTION AND PRESERVATION OF THE HERITAGE.
 TOGETHER WITH THE HERITAGE AGENCIES, WE WILL WORK TO MAKE 
HERITAGE SITES ACCESSIBLE TO THE PUBLIC. 

BROADCASTING

WE ARE PROUD OF OUR RECORD OF EXTENDING CHOICE, ENCOURAGING 
NEW PRODUCERS AND MAINTAINING HIGH STANDARDS IN BROADCASTING. 
WE OPENED THE WAY TO THE SETTING-UP OF CHANNEL 4, INDEPENDENT 
RADIO, SATELLITE TELEVISION AND MULTI-CHANNEL CABLE TV NETWORKS. 
THE 1990 BROADCASTING ACT MEANS THAT THREE NEW INDEPENDENT 
RADIO SERVICES AND A FIFTH TELEVISION CHANNEL WILL BE SET UP 
DURING THE NEXT PARLIAMENT. OVER TWO MILLION HOMES ALREADY 
RECEIVE SATELLITE TV. WE HAVE NOW LICENSED WELL OVER 100 CABLE 
TV NETWORKS AND THIS NEW INDUSTRY EXPECTS TO INVEST £3,000 
MILLION OVER THE NEXT FIVE YEARS. IN COMING YEARS, BRITISH 
VIEWERS WILL HAVE AN INCREASING CHOICE OF CHANNELS AND 
PROGRAMMES. THE NEW AND SOPHISTICATED CABLE NETWORKS WILL 
OPEN THE WAY NOT ONLY TO NEW TELECOMMUNICATION SERVICES, BUT 
ALSO TO THE SPREAD OF EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES SUCH AS HIGH 
DEFINITION TELEVISION.  
   WE ATTACH GREAT IMPORTANCE TO THE WORK OF THE BROADCASTING 
STANDARDS COUNCIL, WHICH WE SET UP UNDER THE 1990 ACT. ALL 
TELEVISION AND RADIO COMPANIES ACCEPT THE NEED TO MAINTAIN 
STANDARDS OF TASTE AND DECENCY IN THEIR TREATMENT OF SEX AND 
VIOLENCE AND THEIR USE OF BAD LANGUAGE.  
   THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITY REGULATES STANDARDS IN SATELLITE 
BROADCASTS ORIGINATING FROM EACH MEMBER STATE. WE WERE ONE 
OF THE FIRST COUNTRIES TO RATIFY A NEW COUNCIL OF EUROPE 
CONVENTION APPLYING SIMILAR RULES TO ALL ITS MEMBER STATES. WE 
ALSO, IN THE BROADCASTING ACT, BROUGHT IN SANCTIONS AGAINST THE 
TRANSMISSION OF OFFENSIVE SATELLITE BROADCASTS FROM ABROAD. AND 
MADE IT AN OFFENCE FOR ADVERTISERS AND EQUIPMENT SUPPLIERS TO 
SUPPORT SUCH PROGRAMMES.  
   INDEPENDENT TELEVISION PRODUCERS ARE BENEFITING FROM THE 
REQUIREMENT PUT ON THE BBC AND ITV TO COMMISSION A QUARTER 
OF ALL THEIR PROGRAMMES, EXCLUDING THE NEWS, FROM OUTSIDERS. 
THERE ARE NOW GREAT OPPORTUNITIES FOR INDEPENDENT PRODUCERS TO 
SELL THEIR PROGRAMMES TO NEW TELEVISION CHANNELS AND 
INTERNATIONAL MARKETS, AND THERE IS MUCH GREATER CHOICE FOR 
VIEWERS AS A RESULT.   
  IN 1996, THE BBC'S CHARTER COMES UP FOR RENEWAL. THIS WILL BE 
CONSIDERED AGAINST THE BACKGROUND OF THE MUCH MORE VARIED 
AND COMPETITIVE BROADCASTING ENVIRONMENT WHICH OUR POLICIES 
HAVE CREATED. IT IS IMPORTANT THAT THERE SHOULD BE A WIDE PUBLIC 
DEBATE ABOUT THE FUTURE DIRECTION THE BBC SHOULD TAKE.
 WE WILL BACK THE WORK OF THE BROADCASTING STANDARDS 
COUNCIL AND REMAIN VIGILANT ABOUT ENSURING HIGH STANDARDS IN 
SATELLITE BROADCAST FROM ABROAD.
 WE WILL PUBLISH A DISCUSSION PAPER ON THE FUTURE OF THE BBC 
RECOGNISING ITS SPECIAL RESPONSIBILITIES FOR PROVIDING PUBLIC 
SERVICE BROADCASTING.
 
A UNITED KINGDOM

THE UNITED KINGDOM IS FAR GREATER THAN THE SUM OF ITS PARTS. 
OVER MANY CENTURIES ITS NATIONS HAVE WORKED, AND FREQUENTLY 
FOUGHT, SIDE BY SIDE. TOGETHER, WE HAVE MADE A UNIQUE MARK ON 
HISTORY. TOGETHER, WE HOLD A SPECIAL PLACE IN INTERNATIONAL 
AFFAIRS. TO BREAK UP THE UNION NOW WOULD DIMINISH OUR 
INFLUENCE FOR GOOD IN THE WORLD, JUST AT THE TIME WHEN IT IS MOST 
NEEDED.   
  NATIONALIST PLANS FOR INDEPENDENCE ARE A RECIPE FOR WEAKNESS 
AND ISOLATION. HIGHER TAXES AND POLITICAL UNCERTAINTY WOULD 
DETER INVESTMENT AND DESTROY JOBS. THE COSTLY LABOUR AND 
LIBERAL DEVOLUTION PROPOSALS FOR SCOTLAND AND WALES HAVE THE 
SAME DRAWBACKS. THEY DO NOT INTEND TO BRING ABOUT SEPARATION, 
BUT RUN THAT RISK. THEY COULD FEED, BUT NOT RESOLVE, GRIEVANCES 
THAT ARISE IN DIFFERENT PARTS OF BRITAIN. THEY WOULD DEPRIVE 
SCOTLAND AND WALES OF THEIR RIGHTFUL SEATS IN THE UNITED 
KINGDOM CABINET, SEATS THE CONSERVATIVES ARE DETERMINED TO 
PRESERVE. WE BELIEVE STRONGLY THAT WE SHOULD GO ON WORKING 
TOGETHER IN FULL PARTNERSHIP IN A UNION THAT HAS SERVED EVERY 
PART OF THE UNITED KINGDOM WELL.  
   THE PLANS FOR DEVOLUTION PUT FORWARD BY THE OTHER PARTIES 
WOULD HAVE A GRAVE IMPACT NOT JUST ON WALES, BUT ALSO ON 
ENGLAND. THEY PROPOSE NEW AND COSTLY REGIONAL ASSEMBLIES FOR 
WHICH THERE IS NO DEMAND. WE WILL OPPOSE ALL SUCH UNNECESSARY 
LAYERS OF GOVERNMENT. THE UNION HAS BROUGHT US STRENGTH BOTH 
ECONOMICALLY AND POLITICALLY. YET IT HAS PRESERVED THE HISTORIC 
AND CULTURAL DIVERSITY OF OUR ISLANDS. OUR CONSTITUTION IS 
FLEXIBLE, FAIR AND TOLERANT. IT HAS MADE THIS COUNTRY ONE OF THE 
BEST PLACES IN WHICH TO LIVE, WORK AND BRING UP OUR CHILDREN. 
THESE BENEFITS CANNOT BE TOSSED AWAY LIGHTLY. WE WILL FIGHT TO 
PRESERVE THE UNION, A PROMISE WHICH ONLY THE CONSERVATIVES 
CAN GIVE AT THIS ELECTION. 

SCOTLAND

SCOTLAND HAS ACHIEVED AN ECONOMIC AND CULTURAL REGENERATION 
OVER THE PAST 13 YEARS. THE SCOTTISH ECONOMY HAS RESPONDED 
VIGOROUSLY TO THE POLICIES WE HAVE INTRODUCED TO LIBERATE 
ENTERPRISE, AND MANY MORE PEOPLE ARE NOW SAVING, INVESTING 
AND OWNING THEIR HOMES. THE PUBLIC SERVICES ARE BETTER FUNDED 
AND MORE EFFICIENT. THERE HAS BEEN A FLOWERING OF SCOTTISH 
CULTURE.   
  SCOTLAND ENJOYS A RICH AND DISTINCT TRADITION AND HER OWN 
INSTITUTIONS, WHICH WE HAVE PRESERVED AND STRENGTHENED. 
SCOTLAND HAS ITS OWN FRAMEWORK FOR THE ENCOURAGEMENT OF 
ENTERPRISE, INVESTMENT AND TRAINING; ITS OWN EDUCATION SYSTEM 
WHICH CONTINUES TO EXCEL, WITH MORE PUPILS LEAVING SCHOOL 
BETTER QUALIFIED AND MORE GOING ON TO FURTHER AND HIGHER 
EDUCATION; ITS OWN HEALTH BUDGETS WHICH DELIVER HIGH STANDARDS 
OF CARE; AND ITS OWN GLORIOUS INHERITANCE OF BUILDINGS AND 
COUNTRYSIDE.  
   A SEPARATE MANIFESTO FOR SCOTLAND SETS OUT OUR RECORD IN DETAIL 
AND OUR PROPOSALS FOR BUILDING ON THESE ACHIEVEMENTS. IN THIS 
DOCUMENT, THEREFORE, WE LIST ONLY A SELECTION. BUSINESS IN 
SCOTLAND HAS RECEIVED A BOOST FROM OUR CREATION OF SCOTTISH 
ENTERPRISE AND THE LOCAL ENTERPRISE COMPANIES. WE HAVE FORMED 
SCOTTISH TRADE INTERNATIONAL TO HELP OUR EXPORTERS, AS LOCATE IN 
SCOTLAND DOES FOR INWARD INVESTORS. TO ASSIST BUSINESS FURTHER, 
WE WILL COMPLETE THE HARMONISATION OF BUSINESS RATES IN 
SCOTLAND WITH THOSE IN THE REST OF THE COUNTRY.
 THE MASSIVE BUREAUCRACIES AND LAYERS OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT 
HAVE FEW SUPPORTERS IN SCOTLAND. WE WILL CONTINUE TO PRESS 
LOCAL AUTHORITIES TO PROVIDE THE VALUE FOR MONEY AND THE QUALITY 
OF SERVICES THAT PEOPLE EXPECT. WE WILL PRESS AHEAD WITH THE 
REFORM OF THE CURRENT BURDENSOME SYSTEM OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT 
BY INTRODUCING SINGLE TIER COUNCILS THROUGHOUT SCOTLAND.
 WE WILL CONTINUE TO STRENGTHEN SCOTLAND'S EDUCATION SYSTEM 
FOR THE BENEFIT OF PARENTS, PUPILS AND TEACHERS. WE WILL RESPOND 
TO THE PROPOSALS OF THE HOWIE COMMITTEE TO ENSURE THAT UPPER 
SECONDARY EDUCATION MATCHES THE BEST IN EUROPE. WE WILL 
CONTINUE TO INCREASE THE NUMBER OF PLACES IN HIGHER AND FURTHER 
EDUCATION AND WILL COMPLETE OUR REFORMS OF THE SYSTEM.
 WE WILL EXTEND OUR REFORMS TO IMPROVE NHS PATIENT CARE IN 
SCOTLAND. SCOTLAND HAS LED THE WAY IN SETTING LIMITS TO WAITING-
TIMES FOR OPERATIONS AND WILL NOW BE REDUCING THESE FURTHER.
 WE ARE CREATING A NEW BODY, SCOTTISH NATURAL HERITAGE, WITH 
OVERALL RESPONSIBILITY FOR CONSERVING THE NATURAL ENVIRONMENT. 
WE WILL GO FURTHER, AND WILL CREATE A SCOTTISH ENVIRONMENTAL 
PROTECTION AGENCY TO BRING TOGETHER POWERS TO ENSURE THE 
QUALITY OF OUR AIR, RIVERS AND BATHING WATERS.
 
  WALES

SINCE 1979, THE ECONOMY OF WALES HAS CHANGED SPECTACULARLY. 
WITH ONLY FIVE PER CENT OF THE UNITED KINGDOM'S POPULATION, 
WALES HAS CONSISTENTLY ENJOYED 20 PER CENT OF ITS INWARD 
INVESTMENT. NEW I~ INDUSTRIES HAVE SPRUNG UP. SELF-
EMPLOYMENT HAS RISEN BY TWO-THIRDS. WELSH MANUFACTURING NOW 
HAS THE HIGHEST PRODUCTIVITY OF ANY PART IN THE UNITED KINGDOM. 
:
    LAND MADE DERELICT BY OLD INDUSTRIES HAS BEEN RECLAIMED ON A 
MASSIVE SCALE. THE CARDIFF BAY DEVELOPMENT AND THE EBBW 
VALE GARDEN FESTIVAL ARE OUTSTANDING EXAMPLES, TOGETHER WITH 
THE PROGRAMME FOR THE VALLEYS. SINCE 1979, WE HAVE SPENT 
MORE THAN £3,000 MILLION ON ROADS IN WALES. SPENDING ON 
HEALTH HAS INCREASED BY 60 PER CENT IN REAL TERMS SINCE 1979. 
WE HAVE SPENT  MORE THAN £5 MILLION ON OUR RADICAL 'WAITING 
TIMES INITIATIVE', LEADING TO THE TREATMENT OF 35.000 EXTRA 
PATIENTS. IN SCHOOL WE ARE SPENDING NEARLY HALF AS MUCH AGAIN. 
IN REAL TERMS PER PUPIL, AS IN 1979. AND THERE HAS BEEN AN 
ENORMOUS EXPANSION IN THE TRAINING BUDGET.
    MORE WELSH HOMES-72 PER CENT-ARE OWNED BY THOSE WHO 
LIVE IN THEM THAN IN THE UNITED KINGDOM AS A WHOLE. SINCE THE 
RIGHT TO BUY WAS INTRODUCED IN 1980, WE HAVE ENABLED ALMOST 
90,000 COUNCIL AND HOUSING ASSOCIATION TENANTS TO BUY THEIR 
OWN HOME
    A SEPARATE MANIFESTO, IN BOTH ENGLISH AND WELSH, SETS OUT 
OUR FULL PROGRAMME FOR BUILDING ON THESE ACHIEVEMENTS FOR 
WALES.
 WE WILL SET UP A WELSH ECONOMIC COUNCIL TO BRING TOGETHER 
THE VARIOUS BODIES WITH INTERESTS IN INWARD INVESTMENT, TOURISM 
AND SMALL BUSINESS TO ADVISE THE SECRETARY OF STATE.
 WE AIM TO REMOVE ALL SIGNIFICANT DERELICTION FROM WALES BY 
THE END OF THE NEW PARLIAMENT.
 WE WILL PROMOTE THE WORK OF THE COUNTRYSIDE COUNCIL FOR 
WALES, IN ORDER TO PROTECT THE COUNTRYSIDE AND THOSE WHO EARN 
THEIR LIVELIHOOD THERE.
 WE WILL GIVE FURTHER RESOURCES TO OUR RURAL INITIATIVE. AND WE 
WILL CONTINUE TO SUPPORT HILL FARMERS THROUGH THE HILL LIVESTOCK 
COMPENSATORY ALLOWANCES.
 WE WILL CONTINUE TO INVEST HEAVILY IN ROAD IMPROVEMENTS, 
INCLUDING THE SECOND SEVERN BRIDGE, COMPLETING THE M4 IN 
SOUTH WALES AND THE A55 IN NORTH WALES.
 WE WILL CONTINUE WITH OUR RECORD HOSPITAL BUILDING 
PROGRAMME.
 WE WILL CONTINUE TO OFFER GENEROUS FUNDING FOR HOUSING FOR 
WALES AND CONCENTRATE OUR EFFORTS ON THE SPECIAL NEEDS OF RURAL 
WALES. ALL MAJOR PUBLICLY FUNDED HOUSING DEVELOPMENTS WILL 
MAKE ADEQUATE PROVISION FOR THE LESS WELL OFF.
 WE WILL INTRODUCE A NEW WELSH LANGUAGE ACT.
 WE WILL PUBLISH A WHITE PAPER ON LOCAL GOVERNMENT REFORM 
THIS AUTUMN WITH A VIEW TO ESTABLISHING UNITARY AUTHORITIES, 
BASED ON THE HISTORIC COUNTIES AND COUNTY BOROUGHS. WE WILL 
ENSURE A FULL ROLE FOR COMMUNITY COUNCILS UNDER THESE 
ARRANGEMENTS.
 
  NORTHERN IRELAND

WE HAVE UPHELD OUR PLEDGE THAT NORTHERN IRELAND WILL REMAIN 
AN INTEGRAL PART OF THE UNITED KINGDOM IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE 
DEMOCRATICALLY EXPRESSED WISHES OF THE MAJORITY OF THE PEOPLE 
WHO LIVE THERE. IT IS A PLEDGE THAT ONLY THE CONSERVATIVE AND 
UNIONIST PARTY CAN GIVE. CONSERVATIVE CANDIDATES ARE STANDING 
IN OUR NAME AND IN THAT CAUSE.  
   OUR OVERRIDING OBJECTIVE IN NORTHERN IRELAND IS TO ELIMINATE 
THE EVIL OF TERRORISM. THIS REQUIRES PROGRESS IN FOUR AREAS: 
SECURITY, ECONOMIC. SOCIAL AND POLITICAL. THE SECURITY FORCES IN 
NORTHERN IRELAND PERFORM THEIR DUTIES WITH COURAGE AND 
PROFESSIONALISM. THEY ARE ENTITLED TO EXPECT ALL THE NECESSARY 
ENCOURAGEMENT, AND LEGAL AND MATERIAL SUPPORT FROM THE 
GOVERNMENT. UNDER THE CONSERVATIVES, THE STRENGTH OF THE RUC 
HAS BEEN INCREASED, WHILE THE EMERGENCY PROVISIONS ACT 1991 
CONTAINS NEW POWERS TO COMBAT TERRORIST FUNDING.  
   NORTHERN IRELAND IS SHARING IN THE ECONOMIC TRANSFORMATION OF 
THE UNITED KINGDOM AS A RESULT OF CONSERVATIVE POLICIES. 
BELFAST IS ATTRACTING SIGNIFICANT NEW PRIVATE INVESTMENT. 
HARLAND AND WOLFF AND SHORTS HAVE BEEN SUCCESSFULLY 
PRIVATISED. MAJOR WORK IS ALSO UNDER WAY TO REGENERATE 
LONDONDERRY AND MANY OF ULSTER'S SMALLER TOWNS. WE WILL 
CONTINUE TO PURSUE POLICIES TO ENCOURAGE ENTERPRISE AND BRING 
NEW JOBS-BY CONTRAST WITH LABOUR, WHOSE PLAN FOR A NATIONAL 
MINIMUM WAGE WOULD HIT THE PROVINCE PARTICULARLY HARD.   
  IN THE NEW PARLIAMENT WE WILL CONTINUE TO SEEK TO RE-ESTABLISH 
STABLE INSTITUTIONS OF GOVERNMENT IN NORTHERN IRELAND, SO THAT 
POWERS CURRENTLY EXERCISED BY MINISTERS IN THE NORTHERN IRELAND 
OFFICE CAN BE RETURNED TO LOCALLY ELECTED POLITICIANS.
 WE WILL ALWAYS GIVE THE SECURITY FORCES OUR FULL BACKING 
WITHIN THE RULE OF THE LAW, AND-AGAINST LABOUR OPPOSITION-
ENSURE THAT THEY HAVE THE SPECIAL POWERS THEY NEED TO PROTECT 
THE WHOLE COMMUNITY FROM VIOLENCE.
 WE WILL COMPLETE THE PRIVATISATION OF NORTHERN IRELAND 
ELECTRICITY, TRANSFER THE WATER AND SEWAGE SERVICES TO THE PRIVATE 
SECTOR, AND EXAMINE WAYS OF BRINGING PRIVATE SECTOR SKILLS INTO 
THE MANAGEMENT OF NORTHERN IRELAND RAILWAYS.
 WE WILL CONTINUE TO PURSUE POLICIES DESIGNED TO ALLEVIATE 
SOCIAL NEEDS, TO PROMOTE EQUITY OF TREATMENT AND TO WIDEN THE 
SENSE OF COMMON PURPOSE WHICH IS GROWING IN THE PROVINCE. 
WE WILL BUILD ON THE DOSE SECURITY COOPERATION THAT HAS BEEN 
ESTABLISHED WITH THE REPUBLIC OF IRELAND UNDER THE ANGLO-IRISH 
AGREEMENT.
 WE WILL CONTINUE TO WORK STRENUOUSLY FOR A POLITICAL 
AGREEMENT WHICH IS ACCEPTABLE TO ALL THE PARTIES INVOLVED IN THE 
TALKS WHICH THE SECRETARY OF STATE HAS HAD DURING THE PAST YEAR 
WITH THE MAIN CONSTITUTIONAL PARTIES IN NORTHERN IRELAND AND THE 
GOVERNMENT OF THE REPUBLIC OF IRELAND. THEY HAVE PROVIDED A 
FIRM BASIS FOR POLITICAL PROGRESS IN ULSTER, AND FOR BUILDING NEW 
RELATIONSHIPS BOTH BETWEEN NORTHERN IRELAND AND THE REPUBLIC, 
AND IN THESE ISLANDS AS A WHOLE. 

YOUR CHOICE AT THIS ELECTION

THIS ELECTION IS ABOUT THE FUTURE. YOUR FUTURE. BRITAIN'S FUTURE. 
OUR FUTURE ROLE IN THE WORLD. THIS IS A TIME TO GO FORWARD WITH 
CONVICTION AND CONFIDENCE, NOT TO GO BACK TO THE FAILURE AND 
BITTER CONTROVERSIES OF THE PAST. IT IS DIFFICULT TO REMEMBER THE 
BRITAIN WE WERE ELECTED TO TRANSFORM IN 1979. THE COUNTRY WE 
DID TRANSFORM. IT WAS A DEPRESSED AND DIVIDED COUNTRY, 
ACCUSTOMED TO FAILURE AND SUSPICIOUS OF CHANGE.   
  DURING THE SUCCEEDING PARLIAMENTS, WE HAVE CURBED INFLATION, 
REFORMED TRADE UNION LAW ENCOURAGED ENTERPRISE, CUT TAXES, 
MODERNISED OUR EDUCATION AND TRAINING, IMPROVED THE 
MANAGEMENT OF OUR HEALTH SERVICE, GIVEN MORE HELP TO THE 
NEEDY, EXTENDED OWNERSHIP. HELPED THROUGH OUR VIGILANCE TO 
END THE COLD WAR, WIDENED OUR INFLUENCE IN EUROPE, AND 
EARNED THE RESPECT OF THE WORLD.   
  A DECADE OF SUCCESS ENDED WITH THE PROBLEMS OF RECESSION-A 
WORLD RECESSION. WE KNOW HOW TOUGH IT HAS BEEN FOR MANY BUT 
WE ARE POISED TO MOVE FORWARD AGAIN, LACKING ONLY THE SPARK OF 
CONFIDENCE WITH WHICH A CONSERVATIVE VICTORY WOULD IGNITE 
RECOVERY. 

THE CHALLENGE AHEAD

THE CHALLENGES OF THE 1990S DEMAND A RESPONSIBLE AND SURE-
FOOTED GOVERNMENT WHICH UNDERSTANDS THE NATURE OF THE 
ACHIEVEMENTS OF THE 1980S AND IS READY TO BUILD SUCCESSFULLY ON 
THEM. A GOVERNMENT COMMITTED TO THE PRINCIPLES OF CHOICE, 
OWNERSHIP, RESPONSIBILITY AND OPPORTUNITY; COMMITTED TO LOW 
INFLATION AND LOW TAXES; COMMITTED TO BETTER QUALITY AND VALUE 
IN OUR PUBLIC SERVICES; COMMITTED TO STRONG DEFENCES. LABOUR 
CANNOT PROVIDE THAT LEADERSHIP. THEY LACK EXPERIENCE, PRINCIPLE 
AND VISION.  
   WITH SOCIALISM EVERYWHERE IN ROUT OR RETREAT, IT IS UNCLEAR 
WHAT THE LABOUR PARTY STANDS FOR. FOR PUBLIC CONSUMPTION, 
LABOUR LEADERS PURPORT TO HAVE JETTISONED THE PRINCIPLES OF A 
LIFE-TIME. BUT HOW MUCH CAN THEY BE TRUSTED? HOW GENUINE IS 
THE CONVERSION AND WHAT DO THEY ACTUALLY BELIEVE?  
   IT IS CLEAR ONLY THAT LABOUR WOULD THREATEN OUR ACHIEVEMENTS, 
UNDO OUR REFORMS AND HAMSTRING BRITAIN. THEY WOULD TURN THE 
CLOCK BACK TO POLICIES THAT IMPOVERISHED AND DIVIDED OUR 
COUNTRY. SOCIALISM HERE AND ABROAD IS THE REGRET OF YESTERDAY 
NOT THE HOPE OF TOMORROW. 

ONLY THE BEST FOR BRITAIN

WE BELIEVE THAT ONLY THE BEST IS GOOD ENOUGH FOR BRITAIN, AND 
THAT THE BEST WILL ONLY BE ACCOMPLISHED IF WE GIVE THE BRITISH 
PEOPLE THE FREEDOM AND THE OPPORTUNITY THEY NEED TO SUCCEED.   
  WE HAVE A NEW LEADER, PROVEN IN OFFICE, AND A NEW AGENDA-
YET A TRIED SET OF PRINCIPLES. THOSE PRINCIPLES REFLECT OUR 
CONVICTION THAT BRITAIN HAS DONE BEST WHEN THE PEOPLE OF 
BRITAIN HAVE BEEN GIVEN THE PERSONAL INCENTIVE TO SUCCEED. 
NATIONAL SUCCESS HAS NOT BEEN PRIMARILY THE RESULT OF ACCIDENTS 
OF GEOGRAPHY, LANDSCAPE AND NATURAL RESOURCES. NOR HAS IT BEEN 
THE RESULT OF GOVERNMENT ACTION AND STATE CONTROL. SUCCESS HAS 
BEEN WON WHEN WE HAVE GIVEN OUR PEOPLE THEIR HEAD: WHEN 
THEIR NATURAL SKILLS, TALENTS, ENERGY, THRIFT AND INVENTIVENESS 
HAVE BEEN RELEASED, NOT SUPPRESSED. THAT WAS TRUE WHEN THIS 
CENTURY BEGAN; IT IS STILL TRUE AS THIS CENTURY DRAWS TO ITS CLOSE.  
   BRITAIN SHOULD APPROACH THE MILLENNIUM WITH HEAD AND SPIRITS 
HIGH, WITH A STRONG ECONOMY, WITH A HIGH STANDARD OF LIVING, 
WITH GENEROUSLY ENDOWED AND WELL MANAGED PUBLIC SERVICES, 
AND WITH SECURE DEFENCES. WE WANT BRITAIN TO BE AN EXAMPLE TO 
THE WORLD OF HOW A FREE PEOPLE CAN MAKE THE VERY BEST OF THEIR 
DESTINY. THAT PROSPECT IS WITHIN THE GRASP OF US ALL. WE MUST 
NOW MAKE IT HAPPEN.   
  THE PRIZE IS GREAT, THE HOPE INVIGORATING, THE DREAM ATTAINABLE. 
WE WANT, WITH YOU, TO MAKE THE DREAM A REALITY. A 
CONSERVATIVE GOVERNMENT WILL HELP YOU TO ACHIEVE THE VERY
BEST. THE VERY BEST FUTURE FOR BRITAIN.
