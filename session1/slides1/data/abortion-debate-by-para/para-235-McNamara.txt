I find it tragic that so many hon. and right hon. Members who in the last Parliament walked through the Lobby in support of the outlawing capital punishment could at the same time support the Bill before us today. Had I been a Member of the House then, the same motives which would have taken me into the Lobby in support of my hon. Friend the Member for Nelson and Colne (Mr. Sydney Silverman) would make me reject this Bill. There are many hon. Members who wish to speak. I would prefer to continue with my argument. I have sat here since 11 o'clock this morning listening to the debate and wanting to interupt, but I did not do so. I ask for the same courtesy from other hon. Members.
