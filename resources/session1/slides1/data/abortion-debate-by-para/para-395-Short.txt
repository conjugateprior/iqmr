Last year, 4,000 girls under the age of 16, most of them still at school, had illegitimate babies. This is alarming doctors and social workers alike. Several local authorities have opened homes for unmarried mothers. Many schoolgirl mothers aged 11 and 12 are being cared for by local authorities. It seems to me that Sweden, Denmark and other countries which are prepared to relieve children of this age of unwanted pregnancies are very much more progressive than we are.
