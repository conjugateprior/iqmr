That said, what should one's attitude be to the Bill as a whole? The most agreeable and easiest course would be to give it conditional support. But the hon. Member for Roxburgh, Selkirk and Peebles has been very fair to the House about his attitude to Committee. He indicated that those who are opposed to the Bill should not seek by Amendment or by some other means the course that they desire. One cannot be opposed to half the provisions, give unqualified sup- port, to a quarter of the Bill and reluctant support to a quarter, and then offer conditional support. Therefore, I reluctantly oppose.
