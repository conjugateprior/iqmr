The case for the Bill has rested partly on utilitarian consideratians  that there is a high number of illegal abortions and that this Bill would reduce them. It is my view that both these propositions are ill-founded. In the nature of the case there can be no reliable statistics on the number of illegal abortions. The degree of variation is so wide that one could only call it wild.
