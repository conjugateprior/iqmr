When Lord Silkin's Bill was debated in another place there was near-unanimity on this provision at least. The more difficult questions are whether we should go further and legalise abortion in the circumstances set out in paragraphs and of Clause 1. I would not try to pretend that those provisions do not raise problems both of practice and of principle. It can be argued that the only satisfactory reform of the law, once it is accepted that it would be wrong simply to place the present case law on a statutory basis, would be to permit any doctor to terminate a pregnancy at his discretion  provided, of course, that this coincided with the wishes of the pregnant woman herself.
