 I am in a middle position in which I greatly approve of part of the Bill and do not approve of the rest. I shall listen to find out whether any undertakings can be given to help me on paragraphs and , but so far they have not been given. This is the problem which affects all of us. We have each separately to make up our minds on the Bill, which is of great importance. I am glad that it is being treated on an entirely nonparty basis.
