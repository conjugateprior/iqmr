I agree with the sponsor that it is wrong that these matters of great impor- tance should be left entirely to private Members. So much depends on the vote today. I hope that there will be very strong support for the Bill and that it can go to Committee for detailed discussion. If, however, by any unhappy chance it should fall by the wayside, I hope that the strength of opinion shown in the House will be such that the Government will feel bound to take it over.
