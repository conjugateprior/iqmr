It is an even more difficult subject for those who, like myself, have the strongest and even decisive reservations about these proposals. I think that the first instinct of a layman, who is not a doctor or a lawyer, and cannot speak authoritatively for the Church, is really to steer clear of the subject altogether. That is much the easiest course. Yet I do not think that it would be right, which is why I now seek briefly, and however indifferently, to explain why I cannot support the Bill as it stands and, I am quite clear in my mind, is likely to remain.
