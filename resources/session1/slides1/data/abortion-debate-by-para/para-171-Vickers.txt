I am glad that the hon. and learned Member for Walsall, North (Mr. William Wells) has returned to the Chamber, because I did not think that he made a very good case for his point of view. We all have the sanctity of life in mind. I agree with my right hon. Friend the Member for Ashford. We do not want to encourage abortion, but we want to take a step forward in helping the woman concerned.
