It gives me great pleasure to speak immediately after the hon. Lady the Member for Plymouth, Devonport (Dame Joan Vickers). She and I shared the same political platform at an inter-Church meeting and declared our intention to support a Measure of abortion law reform should one come before the House. I support the plea for this Measure to be given Government time. Obviously there should be a free vote, but leaving such Bills to the vagaries and difficulties of Private Members' time means that a Government is shirking this responsibility.
