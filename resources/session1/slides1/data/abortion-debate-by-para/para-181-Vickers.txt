My hon. Friend the Member for Edgbaston referred to the question of family planning and contraceptives. She probably knows that the Birmingham Abortion Law Reform Association has made a study of the situation and has discovered how inadequate are many of the medicines and other preparations sold to women as being fully protective. This evidence comes from her own city. In my opinion, abortion should be allowed where the doctor honestly believes that if pregnancy continues there will be a risk of the patient's dying or becoming a physical or mental wreck.
