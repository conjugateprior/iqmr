My decision was rendered easier by the speech of the hon. Member for Plymouth, Sutton (Dr. David Owen). I think that I agreed with nearly everything he said. I found his attitude in marked and refreshing contrast to that of some of his hon. Friends who, from those who made interjections and sedentary noises to those who wholeheartedly opposed the Bill, suggested that it was their view that this was a simple matter and that anybody who did not accept the whole argument and the whole Bill was automatically obscurantist, inhumane and unintelligent.
