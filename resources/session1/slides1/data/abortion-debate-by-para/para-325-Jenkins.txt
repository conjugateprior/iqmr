Convictions on this problem are held at such a profound level and raise such deep questions of our whole philosophical attitude to life and death that I am doubtful how far it would be useful for me or any other hon. Member to attempt a rational analysis of the merits of the respective positions, or to seek to persuade those who hold the view that every unborn child is a potential human being entitled to life, and that it is always wrong to destroy the foetus. I can only state my own belief that to take the risk of condemning a potential human being to a life likely to be dominated by suffering and hopeless inadequacy is to assume a responsibility at least as profound as to destroy a foetus which may, in the words of the Amendment, be" potentially healthy". We must surely have regard to the likely effect of such a half life upon the mother and the other members of the family concerned as well.
