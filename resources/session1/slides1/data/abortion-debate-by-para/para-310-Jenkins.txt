Some opponents of the Bill include those who most vigorously support and, indeed, occasionally complain about me not affording Government time for  other Measures for liberalising social reform. I notice that the hon. Member for Chelmsford (Mr. St. John-Stevas) is among those who signed the Amendment calling upon the House to decline to give a Second Reading to the Bill at this time.
