I have no doubt that the hon. Gentleman's judgments are good and that he is honest about them, but they may be wholly different from those that others in the medical profession or outside it would take of such topics. To that extent, it is not right that doctors should terminate life upon a judgment as to purely social and economic consequences. If that had been the law during the last 1,000 years, the number of persons born into this world might have been very substantially reduced, because we are constantly going through evolutions in our social and economic conditions and always, unhappily, a substantial proportion of the population are below the average that most people would like to see.
