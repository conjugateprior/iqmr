I have pleasure in supporting the Bill, and I congratulate the hon. Member for Roxburgh, Selkirk and Peebles (Mr. David Steel) on the way in which he introduced it. I should like the House to take particular notice of what was said by the hon. Member for Falmouth and Cam-borne (Dr. John Dunwoody), because on this matter he has more experience than anybody in the House, and I thought that he put his points extremely fairly and reasonably.
