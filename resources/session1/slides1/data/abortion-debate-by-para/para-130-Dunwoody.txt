We heard from the mover of the Amendment that abortion was an abhorrent operation. I could not agree more with him as a doctor, but then so is so much else which doctors have to do. Because things are abhorrent we must not prevent people doing them if we think it is right that they should be done. I think there are circumstances where abortion for all its abhorrence is something which is right and proper to do.
