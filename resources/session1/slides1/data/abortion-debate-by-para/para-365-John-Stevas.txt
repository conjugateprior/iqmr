The second point made in favour of the Bill is that it would reduce the number of illegal abortions. It may, but the experience of other countries, such as Sweden, and certainly Eastern European countries, is quite the opposite. Illegal and legal abortions go up together. The only way that one will get rid of illegal abortions is to get rid of restrictions altogether. That will get rid of illegal abortions ; nothing else will. Presumably that is a view which some supporters at least of the Bill take.
