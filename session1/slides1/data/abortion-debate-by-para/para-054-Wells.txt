There is a third approach which I would wish to put before the House. This matter is sometimes argued as though it were an issue between enlighten- ment and obscurantism.

They bracket it with capital punishment, the legalisation of homosexual practices between consenting male adults in private and even almost the nationalisation of iron and steel.
