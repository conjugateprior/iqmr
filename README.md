# iqmr

IQMR slides and course materials, slowly morphing into an R package.

* `resources` contains a (free) font you may not have but will need to
  have installed to make the slides compile.

* The slides are a beamer style called `metropolis` which you'll want to install
  in your latex distro.  If you are using Mactex like a sensible person then open
  up `Tex Live Utility`, select the middle `Packages` tab, search for `metropolis` 
  packages in the search window, and right click to install it.

* Slides are in flux.  No need to worry about those.

## TODO

* Beef up precision recall for dictionary material - think down matrix stuff
