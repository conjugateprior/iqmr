I hope that we shall give the Bill a Second Reading, so that we can discuss in Committee how the law should be changed, and so that other people who have not had a chance of doing so today can put forward their views. I have some experience in respect of Private Members' Bills. Mine, regrettably, was talked out. I hope that this will not be. I hope, however, that if it is the Government will have the courage as Mr. Butler, as he then was, had in respect of my Bill to take it over.
