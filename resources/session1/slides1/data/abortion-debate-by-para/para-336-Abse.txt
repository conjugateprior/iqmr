Even if we come to the conclusion that it must proceed, in some measure the passing of the Bill is bound to be a proclamation of defeat on behalf of the community. If it were a very widely drawn Bill, it could be a proclamation of bitter defeat. If it were more narrowly drawn, it could be a defeat, just the same. No hon. Member who acknowledges that life is our most precious gift can possibly view with enthusiasm a Bill whose declared object is to thwart the life of the unborn babe.
