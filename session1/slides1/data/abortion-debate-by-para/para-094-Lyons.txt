Bradford has always bred a sturdy independence. Its people twice shed their blood in the Parliamentary cause resisting Royalist sieges on their city. Wool packs, Bradford's alternative to sandbags, shielded the cathedral from Royalist cannon. The city is the wool textile centre of the world. Its exports of wool created the words" British made" as a universal symbol of quality. Its name means" at the broad ford" , and it has over the centuries tolerantly absorbed into the broad stream of the city's life many immigrants and many new and excellent ideas. I am sure that Bradford's views on abortion are humane and enlightened.
