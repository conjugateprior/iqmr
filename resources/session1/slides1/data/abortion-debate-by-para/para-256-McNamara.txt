It is popularly thought, not without some ground, that a mother as mentally defective as defined in the Acts is more likely than a normal woman to have a mentally defective child in the sense of the 1959 Act and to be more likely of being incapable of rearing such a child. While this broad generalisation cannot be disputed, it is another matter whether or not this should be regarded as adequate grounds for terminating a pregnancy. With slighter degrees of subnormality, the transmission of defectiveness varies tremendously and many healthy and normal children are born to such mothers.
