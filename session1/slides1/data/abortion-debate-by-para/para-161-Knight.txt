I have been reading from a letter which was sent to me with the full approval and support of obstetricians in the Birmingham area, some of whom are constituents of mine. None of us here is as expert as those men, and they say, from a lifetime of experience, that it is wrong that we in this House should presume to take such a decision when we do not know enough about it.
