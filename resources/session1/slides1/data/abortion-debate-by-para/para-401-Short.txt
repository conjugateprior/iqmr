Before I conclude I should say something that I think perhaps will counteract some of the speeches that have come from the Birmingham direction. We must consider what happens to some of the unfortunate unwanted children born into inadequate homes, disabled children, mentally defective children. They come into the care of the local authority. A research project has been carried out by a Birmingham University social worker, who shows that it is not uncommon for a child of this kind to have up to 10 different homes in five years.
