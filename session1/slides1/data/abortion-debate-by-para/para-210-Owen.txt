I should like the next Private Member's Bill to provide that when a doctor makes his six-week post-natal examination the onus is placed on him to introduce the question of family planning. It would be for the woman to decide whether she wished it to be discussed, but this is a positive contribution which must be made by the medical profession in order to spread advice about contraception throughout the country. The necessity to make this very difficult decision about abortion would then be markedly reduced.
