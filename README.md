# iqmr

IQMR slides and course materials, slowly morphing into an R package.

* `resources` contains a (free) font you may not have but will need to
  have installed to make the slides compile.

* The slides are a beamer style called `metropolis` which you'll want to install
  in your latex distro.  If you are using Mactex like a sensible person then open
  up `Tex Live Utility`, select the middle `Packages` tab, search for `metropolis` 
  packages in the search window, and right click to install it.

* To compile the slides, use XeLaTeX. `xelatex` from the command line,
  or just switch the engine in TeXShop, or whatever you use.

## TODO

* Slim down and rejig session 1
* Add exploratory with quanteda examples
* Move those to the labs also
* Beef up precision recall for dictionary material - think down matrix stuff

* Session 2 - add stm example
* Check lab still works out 

* Session 3 - add material on scraping - senatorial example
