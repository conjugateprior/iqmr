The hon. Gentleman will agree t hat we have been discussing exactly how far it would be appropriate to raise Committee points on Second Reading, and, clearly, one cannot dissociate one set of points from another. I think that that is pre-eminently a Committee point. The position I am stating from my own personal point of view here is that I see the principle of Clause 1(1, ) as an attempt to deal with a real issue, and that it would be a pity if this issue could not be considered. I am not saying there is a totally satisfactory means of dealing with it in the paragraph as at present drafted, but I do not think that the sponsors of the Bill, though I cannot speak for them, would not be willing to listen to advice on that point, as to any advice which came from the Government Front Bench during Committee.
