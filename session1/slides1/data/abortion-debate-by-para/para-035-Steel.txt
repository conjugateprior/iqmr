The difficulty in drafting a Bill of this kind is to decide how and where to draw the line. We want to stamp out the back-street abortions, but it is not the intention of the Promoters of the Bill to leave a wide open door for abortion on request. The difficulty of finding wording in the Bill which will satisfy both those requirements is clear. Experience in Sweden, which is sometimes mentioned by those who oppose the Bill namely, that following reform of the law illegal abortions still take place suggests that in Sweden they have not overcome this difficulty.
