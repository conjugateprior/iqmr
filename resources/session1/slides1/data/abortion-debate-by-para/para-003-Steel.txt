The issues involved in discussing this Bill today are complex and arouse strong feelings among both the supporters and opponents of the Bill. First, I am grateful that so many Members have decided to remain here on a Friday in order to support this legislation and I also recognise that a number have made equal sacrifices to be present in order to register their strong opposition. I echo what you have already said, Mr. Speaker. I know that many hon. Members wish to speak. I hope that it will be a good debate, and I hope to set a reasonable example by being as brief as possible in introducing a Bill of this complexity.
