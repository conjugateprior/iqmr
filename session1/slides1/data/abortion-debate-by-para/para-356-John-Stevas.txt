We all agree that this has been a vitally important debate, conducted on a level which is worthy of the highest traditions of the House, and rightly so, because we are dealing with issues of paramount importance both to our morality and to our future as a society. I should like to join in the congratulations which have been expressed to the hon. Member for Roxburgh, Selkirk and Peebles (Mr. David Steel) on the manner in which he introduced the Bill, which he did with extraordinary moderation and skill, and I should also like to congratulate the hon. and learned Member for Walsall, North (Mr. William Wells), who moved the Amendment, and, in particular, my hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Edgbaston (Mrs. Knight), who spoke very movingly. After all, a woman has much more right to speak in this debate than has any other hon. Member. I hope, Mr. Speaker, that the hon. Lady the Member for Wolverhampton, North-East (Mrs. Rene√© Short) will catch your eye when I have concluded.
