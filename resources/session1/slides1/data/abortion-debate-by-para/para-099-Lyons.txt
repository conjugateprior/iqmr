It is also unlawful to terminate where the mother has suffered rubella German measles  in early pregnancy, yet the deformity rate from such pregnancies is said to be 30 per cent. That statistic conceals dire disabilities. Some years ago, a general practitioner told me in distress how two gynaecologists in his West Riding town had refused to terminate his patient's rubella pregnancy. The law was upheld. The child had just been born, and it was deaf and blind. The mother already had children and she could not cope with this one. It lives out its life in an institution, bereft of sight and sound and of love. I will never know the simplest joys which are taken for granted by the children of the opponents of the Bill.
