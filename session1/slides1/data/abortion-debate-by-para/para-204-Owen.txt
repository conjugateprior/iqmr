I was going on to make this point and of course I agree with this. I sometimes feel anxiety about talking about the Bill, because the issue is balanced on both sides and is very complex. Because of my own indecision and pointing out these difficulties, I sometimes feel that I might harm the Bill. I do not want to do so, but it is right that these things should be pointed out, which is why many psychiatrists give great thought to the matter before recommending a termination of pregnancy.
