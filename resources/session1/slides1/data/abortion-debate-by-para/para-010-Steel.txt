It is right to start by outlining the present state of the law on abortion. In England and Wales, the law is governed by the Offences against the , which in Section 58 refers to the unlawful administering of any poison or noxious thing or the unlawful use of any instrument with intent to procure a miscarriage. Although the word "unlawful" appears in that Act, nowhere in our Statute Law is there any reference to what would be lawful. Therefore, the law in England and Wales has been built up over a series of cases.
