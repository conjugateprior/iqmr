In many countries where rape is a ground for termination in Western Europe, in Scandinavia, in Eastern Europe this difficulty has been overcome. I had the opportunity, only the week before last, in Stockholm, of having a long discussion with a member of the National Medical Board in Sweden, which is the board to which gynaecological, psychiatric and social workers' reports are referred when a woman applies for a termination of pregnancy. It is this board which decides whether the application shall be granted.
