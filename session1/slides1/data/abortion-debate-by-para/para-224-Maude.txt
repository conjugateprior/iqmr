I believe that we may actually find that we are making these solutions more difficult to obtain if we give the idea that abortion is the answer to these problems and that it is something that can be made easier. The pressure to get an abortion in circumstances where it is a struggle for the mother, and where it is only too easy, goodness knows, to feel that the struggle is hopeless and intolerable, may distract attention from the needs for reform in other fields.
