I have seen many women who have been given this support, have reached full term, and have been grateful to the doctor for enabling them to do so, but, equally, I am convinced there are people whose pregnancies have rightly been terminated and who would not have been able to accept the burden of another child. I suggest to the House that, given these considerations and the right of doctors to decide the issues, and aware of the social environment into which we are moving and of the feeling in the country, we should regard the Bill as offering a significant advance in our thinking. I am sure that in Committee it can be clarified and the provisions tightened so that there will be less misunderstanding. We need a little less emotion in discussing the issue and a little more realisation of the extreme complexity of the problem. Given that, I believe that we can make a significant advance and that abortion law reform will be understood by everyone.
