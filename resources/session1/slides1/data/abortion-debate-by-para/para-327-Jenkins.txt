 Sir H. Legge-Bourke: Would the right hon. Gentleman consider that, perhaps, in order to determine whether a woman's capacity as a mother would be affected by pregnancy and birth, in addition to the medical advice referred to at the beginning of Clause 1 some other advice should be brought in? As I understand it, the whole Clause depends upon the opinion of two doctors, a decision of two doctors. Is there a case, perhaps, for bringing in someone else?
