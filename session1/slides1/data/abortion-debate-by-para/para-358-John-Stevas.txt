I accept that position fully. There is one point nevertheless which I must stress and that is the position of those in the medical profession who have a conscientious objection to abortion, which was a point raised by the hon. and learned Member for Walsall, North. The Bill does not require in so many words a doctor or a nurse to carry out an abortion. It is permissive, not mandatory. Yet if it is passed it must create a new state of affairs in which abortion, will be much more extensive as a part of medical practice than at present.
