Even speaking in a personal capacity, I have not attempted to conceal some of the real difficulties from the House. I must add that there are some others relating to the qualifications of the doctors who will be allowed to perform the operations and the places where those operations may take place which fall within the province of my right hon. Friend the Minister of Health. But anyone who knows the record of my right hon. Friend on the subject will not doubt his desire to find a way through them. I think that the House as a whole, if its desire is to proceed on this subject, should also be able to find a way through the difficulties.
