Surely this is correct. After all, who is more affected by the decision to have an abortion than the unborn child whose life is to be snuffed out? When the decision to abort or not is taken, with all the dramatic implications for life and death, everyone can speak except the child. The mother can give her views, the father can give his and the doctor can speak, but the only person who is silent is the person most radically affected. The child cannot rise up in the womb and say," I want to live". Here, surely, the tradition of the Western world is right that the law should intervene to protect the silent child. Which of us if given the choice at that time would have opted for death rather than life?
