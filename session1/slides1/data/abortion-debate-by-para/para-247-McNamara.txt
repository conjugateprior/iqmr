I turn now to Clause 1, in order to make not Committee points, but points of substance. Clause 1(1,a) would appear to be declaratory of the existing law. This would be something which, while from my own ethical point of view I would not like to see it, I would certainly not try to oppose or obstruct. But subsection (1,b) immediately suggests difficulties. The phrases which are used" substantial risk" ," seriously handicapped"  are difficult to interpret and are incapable of precise definition. What exactly does" substantial risk" mean? When Lord Brain wrote his commentary on the first Bill of Lord Silkin in the he pointed out the difficulties which their Lordships have had medically and legally in trying to find a meaning. It is almost impossible to give a definition. How are we to measure this? Where do we draw the line?
