I would say to that same cabal, if they are operating in the House today, that they will be doing a great disservice to themselves if they seek to adopt the tactics over this Bill which they adopted in the past, if they do not allow this Second Reading because they hold particularly religious views. This debate should be voted upon and I hope that the Bill will be given a Second Reading. I hope that the Bill will be thought upon and worked upon in Committee so that it will come back to the House. Then we will have to apologise for it to ourselves, shall have to say," It may be that we have not as yet sufficient medical or psychiatric knowledge, or social services of quality. It may be that there are still lamentable social conditions which compel us to permit abortion. We apologise and, with dismay and no great enthusiasm, we pass the Bill on to the country."
