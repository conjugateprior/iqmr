Of course, many previous attempts have been made in the House to introduce Bills of this kind. One was sponsored by the present Minister of Health. Among the sponsors of my Bill are two hon. Members who have previously attempted to introduce this reform. Perhaps the greatest jolt to public opinion and one reason that there is more interest and discussion in the Press, in the broadcasting media and among the public, was the introduction of a Bill in another place by the noble Lord Silkin, to whom also I would pay tribute. The effect of the passage of that Bill and its detailed discusion in Committee has been significant in bringing public attention to this matter.
