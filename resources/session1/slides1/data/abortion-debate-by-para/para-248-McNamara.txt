Rubella was mentioned earlier and the 30 per cent. chance of a child being born deformed, but what of the other 70 children in that statistical 100? What does the phrase" seriously handicapped" mean? Serious abnormality in pregnancy is now being diagnosed very easily, but although it is being diagnosed very easily this should not overcome the fact that it is still extremely difficult to diagnose abnormality in early stages of pregnancy. For example, when one takes X-rays and the child's bones are then visible, the pregnancy is so far advanced that the child is viable. In certain forms of growth abnormality, the child may not be viable, being a full monster, and in such cases it is often safer to let the pregnancy go full course rather than terminate it and possibly risk the mother's life.
