I apologise to hon. Members for having spoken at length, but to me the sanctity of life of both the mother and the unborn child is of such importance, and the Bill is such a bad Bill, striking at the very roots of my concept of life and of man, that I felt that I had to make my case in some detail, lest it should go by default. I support the Amendment.
