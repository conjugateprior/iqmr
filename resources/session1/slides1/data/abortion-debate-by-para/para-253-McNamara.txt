Subsection (1, ) contains the phrases" capacity as a mother" and" severely overstrained". Again, these are terms which are impossible to interpret or to limit, and they are to some extent ludicrous. How can a woman's capacity to be a mother be measured before she has a child? Fecklessness, a bad background, being a bad manager these are handicaps, but they are nothing to do with love, that indefinable bond, no matter how bad the social conditions, no matter how strange or difficult the circumstances, which links a mother to her child and makes her cherish it.
