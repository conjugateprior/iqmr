The hon. Member for Roxburgh, Selkirk and Peebles said that he would be open to amendments at the Committee stage. I think that he was wise to say that, because the view cannot be taken that the Bill is perfect as drafted. I have seen no abortion Bill yet which is. The hon. Gentleman also said that he would resist Amendments which struck at the root of the Bill, and he was wise to say that.
