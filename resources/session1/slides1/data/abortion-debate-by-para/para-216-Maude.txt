I believe it to be important that the statute law should codify the case law of the Bourne judgment and since. I know the arguments against interfering with the case law that it may rigidify the position and make it more difficult for doctors, but I believe that Parliament should place the position beyond doubt. If my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Warwick and Leamington (Sir J. Hobson) or any other lawyer takes part in the debate, I hope that he will tell us whether the Bill places the position beyond doubt and whether it would codify it in the right way. I think that we ought to know about it and that it ought to be discussed in Committee.
