Friend the Member for Plymouth, Sutton (Dr. David Owen), who spoke as a medical man and as a member of the Royal Medico-Psychological Association, spoke quite rightly about the psychological consequences to a woman who wants to have an abortion and fails to have one. I pointed out and my hon. Friend acknowledged the truth of what I said that there were also serious consequences when a woman had an abortion.
