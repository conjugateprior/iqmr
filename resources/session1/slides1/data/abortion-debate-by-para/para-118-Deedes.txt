I hope that no hon. Member, whether supporting or opposing the Bill will be too sanguine about the Bill's effect in any form in ending the danger, the squalor, the misery of illegal abortions. No one could deny that the Bill, if it passes into law, will make a contribution. But short of comprehensive legislation, permitting abortion in all circumstances, almost as of right, some evasion of the law is inevitable. It may be said that the wider we take the law the fewer evasions there will be. That seems to me to be a dangerous doctrine. I grow rather mistrustful of the doctrine that the right cure for social abuse is to legalise it with suitable restraints. We tried that once with gambling, and the experience there does not encourage me to apply that doctrine in this far more difficult subject.
