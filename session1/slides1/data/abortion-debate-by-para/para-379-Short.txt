We have had some very good speeches, and I should like, first, to congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Bradford, East (Mr. Edward Lyons) on his maiden speech. As the hon. Member for Stratford-on-Avon (Mr. Maude) said, it was a difficult occasion on which to make a maiden speech, and my hon. Friend acquitted himself extremely well.
