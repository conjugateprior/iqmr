Nearly thirty years ago the comprehensive committee which spent some time on taking evidence from lay and medical bodies, and which was chaired by the then Mr. Norman Birkett, K.C., came out in favour of reform of the law. It recommended that the law should be reformed to safeguard doctors who terminated in good faith and to protect the mental and physical health or life of the patient. It said that it would welcome legislation to enable pregnancies resulting from rape to be terminated if a satisfactory solution could be found to the legal difficulties involved. Therefore, as long ago as 1939 a responsible committee recommended that rape should be a ground for termination of pregnancy, provided that the administrative and legal difficulties could be overcome.
