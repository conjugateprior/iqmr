The answer is that the more one extended the scope the graver the problem would be. Every abortion which is carried out has something to do with conscience. Catholic nurses cannot help that because all the abortions that are carried out in hospitals at present have been certified by doctors as being necessary for the health of the patients, and nurses are there, whether they are Catholics or otherwise, to look after the patients.
