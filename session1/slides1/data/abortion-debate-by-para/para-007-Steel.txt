Before I come to the terms of the Bill, I would point out that this has been a difficult choice for me. It remains my view that it is unfortunate that the practice in the House is for controversial social issues of this kind issues such as the abolition of capital punishment to be left entirely to private Members to bring forward. In my opinion, it would be better if the Government, as part of their social reform, were prepared to bring forward these Measures, although leaving them to be decided entirely on a free vote of Members of the House and of the Government. But this is not so, and I therefore had to consider my choice in the light of the present practice of the House.
