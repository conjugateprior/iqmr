Why is there all this hurry to act in ignorance? If one really believed that the law should be changed and that one possessed irrefutable evidence in support, one should want to place such evidence before an independent tribunal to convince the country of its truth and one's own integrity. The reformers have not asked for such an inquiry. Indeed, since the B.M.A. set up its Committee of Inquiry, they have pressed even more strongly for quick law reform. Are they afraid of the truth? They may be, but the country must have the truth before it is asked to legislate. The matter is not so urgent that it cannot wait for the facts to be gathered and for opinions from responsible people to be canvassed properly.
