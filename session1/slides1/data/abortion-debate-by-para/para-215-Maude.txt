I am sorry that my right hon. Friend the Member for Ashford (Mr. Deedes) is not here. I listened, as I always do, with great attention to what he said, because over the many years that I have know him I have come particularly to value the humane and yet penetrating way in which his mind works on social and moral problems of this kind. I want to try to explain to the House why, sharing most of the doubts that he has, I decided marginally that I would vote for the Second Reading of the Bill whereas he decided marginally that he would vote against it.
