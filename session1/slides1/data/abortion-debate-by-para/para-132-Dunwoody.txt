I have been for 12 years a doctor before I came to this House, and I had very considerable obstetric experience. I have been previously consulted, despite this barrier, by women who wanted abortion, women whom I believed morally and socially ought to have an abortion and whom this Bill would allow to have an abortion but, as things stand at the moment, I have had to refuse them. There was nothing I could do. It was quite pointless to refer them to any consultant. I do not believe that this is right for those with over-large families which could become larger still. In years to come the situation would be very much better if we passed this Bill.
