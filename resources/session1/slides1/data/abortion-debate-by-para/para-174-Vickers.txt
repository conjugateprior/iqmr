This interested me considerably. It is only in extreme cases that a woman wants to terminate her pregnancy. I know a young woman who has had two children by two different men, and she is working very hard to bring them up. I think that it is an exaggeration to say that women desire this operation which, as the hon. Member for Falmouth and Cam-borne said, is not a pleasant one. It is carried out only when it is essential for physical or mental reasons.
