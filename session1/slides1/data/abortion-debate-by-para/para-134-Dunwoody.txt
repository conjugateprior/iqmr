As I understand it, it means capacity as a mother in the fullest sense. I think it means something much more than the ability to bear a child or to wean a child. It means the ability to be the person who brings the family together, who knits the various children and the mother and father together, so that the mother can play the part she ought to play in building and maintaining the family unit.
