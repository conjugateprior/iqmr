 I also congratulate the hon. Member for Roxburgh, Selkirk and Peebles (Mr. David Steel) who, whatever view one may take about the Bill, moved its Second Reading in an irreproachable manner. I want to acknowledge at once the very fair way in which he put forward a Bill on this very difficult subject.
