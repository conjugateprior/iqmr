In 1934, there was the first resolution on the subject, passed by a substantial body of people at the Conference of the Women's Co-operative Guilds. In 1935, the National Council of Women added their support, and in the same year the Abortion Law Reform Association was founded. In passing, I should like to pay tribute to the work of the Association over the last 30 years. In 1935 also more than 30 years ago the subject was raised on the Floor of the House, and in the same year the British Medical Association committee reported that it was in favour of a reform of the law, although the report of that year did not go as far as that report which the Association produced recently.
