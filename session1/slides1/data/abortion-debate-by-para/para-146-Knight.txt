After all, there are two ways round an unwanted pregnancy. First, there is family planning. Birth control methods are becoming safer and easier all the time. I absolutely reject the argument used by some emotional do-gooders that poor people do not understand how to use contraceptives. Of course they do ; they are not stupid. I am 100 per cent. in favour of family planning clinics and every bit of advice and help possible being available, but there is every difference in the world between deliberately not starting a baby and deliberately killing one which has been started. People must be helped to be responsible, not encouraged to be irresponsible.
