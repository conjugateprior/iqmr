May I begin my short intervention by congratulating, I am sure on behalf of the whole House, the hon. Member for Roxburgh, Selkirk and Peebles (Mr. David Steel) on the manner in which he moved the Second Reading of the Bill. He did so with great moderation. He marshalled all the facts and arguments both fairly and clearly. His manner of presenting the Bill had the further advantage of being thoroughly unemotional.
