As recently as Monday of this week hon. Members will have noticed a report of a considerable break-through in this respect, namely, an electronic device which can show the contents of the uterus without exposing the mother and the foetus to the dangers of X-rays. We also know that by the withdrawal of amniotic fluid from the uterus it is possible to examine the chromosomal structure. It is also known that serious defects like mongolism can be detected in this way. The B.M.A. Special Committee, which reported earlier this month, said that the risk of serious foetal abnormality should be included as a ground for termination in any amendment of the law. It is significant that, in the poll conducted among women recently. 91 per cent. were in favour of termination on this ground.
