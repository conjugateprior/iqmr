The supporters of the Bill have a theology of their own which has at times been implicit and at times explicit in the course of the debate, namely that every woman has a right to an abortion to get rid of a child that she does not want. That is certainly the view of the Abortion Law Reform Association. I will quote a letter by an official of that association, Mrs. Chataway, to the recently. She concluded her letter by saying: That is very nice if one can arrange it, but to do so one has to choose one's parents extremely carefully. But this is a significant step in the argument because abortion has been changed from a crime, to a right, to a duty. If an unborn child has a right to be born wanted, then if it is not wanted the parents clearly have a duty to dispose of it.
