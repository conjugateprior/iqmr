Of course I am supporting the hon. Member for Kingston-upon-Hull, North (Mr. McNamara). I cannot see how one can consider the Second Reading without considering, also, what is included in those subsections. They are what it is about. One cannot claim that they are technical matters of drafting. They contain the substance of the effect of the Bill. To this extent, we must discuss the details of these pro- visions on Second Reading and hon. Members on both sides, whatever their views, have to make up their minds on subsections and , because they are what the Bill is about.
