There is a strong case for Clause 1 (1, ), but there is a need for caution and for considerable discussion in Committee. I am not as pessimistic as the right hon. and learned Member. I do not think that if, as I hope, the Bill receives a Second Reading, we will therefore forfeit our right in practice so to mould the Bill that it will more commend itself to us. I have had experience of sponsoring a Private Member's Bill, which had a Second Reading and went right through Committee but was finally sabotaged in its final stage by a cabal.
