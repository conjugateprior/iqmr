I would add a further word. I do not think that it would be any use the House pretending that it wanted to reform the law of abortion if, at the same time, it was to be blind to the practical consequences of any real reform. Few things could be worse than to go through the pretence of a reforming Measure and end up with a statutory position which was just as or even more restrictive than the present practice. I do not think that that is what the House wants or what the country wants.
