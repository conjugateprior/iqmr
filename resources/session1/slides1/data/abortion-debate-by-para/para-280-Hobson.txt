The ordinary law affecting people working in factories recognises this. One has to consider, first, not only whether there is a serious risk but whether, if one takes it, anything serious will happen. Secondly, one must consider whether the risk ought to be guarded against, because if anything happens there will be the most serious consequences. It is like a person walking along a narrow, dangerous wall only 6 ft. from the ground. That is a different matter from walking along such a wall 60 ft. high. In the one case, the risk may be acceptable because, although it is a serious risk, the consequences will not be very great. Conversely, if the consequences are to be utterly disastrous one should not accept the risk.
