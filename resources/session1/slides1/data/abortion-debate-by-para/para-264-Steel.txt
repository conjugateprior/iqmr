I hope that the hon. Gentleman has not misunderstood I fear that he has what I tried to say about my attitude towards Amendments. The hon. Gentleman has indeed been relating Committee points. If the hon. Gentleman would be willing to give the Bill a Second Reading, these are precisely the type of points which should be examined in Committee and as to which I should be perfectly prepared to accept alterations to the Bill. I did not intend to suggest that, because they happened to be minor points and because they happened to be made by people who object to the Bill, I would not accept them.
