I should like to say something about the main provisions of the Bill. In doing this, I shall, for the reasons I have explained, have to point to some of the difficulties of interpretation to which they may give rise and to some of the difficulties which I believe can be dealt with in Committee. I deal, first, with the provision in Clause 1 (1, ) that a pregnancy may be terminated where None of us is likely to forget the thalidomide tragedies of four years ago. Many will have personal experience of the suffering caused to both children and parents by such disasters as there may be for women contracting German measles in the early stages of pregnancy. My own conviction is that the circumstances envisaged in this paragraph and the decision whether to terminate a pregnancy should be left to the wishes of the mother and the judgment of her doctors.
