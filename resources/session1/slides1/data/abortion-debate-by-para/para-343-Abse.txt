There are dangers of sterility. The College emphasise the personal tragedy of the premarital abortion which eventually means that when a girl marries she is unable to have children. From my experience in a divorce practice, having seen so many well-documented case histories of abortion within the divorce papers, where an abortion taken too trivially and too lightly in the early years of a marriage has led unfortunately to sterility and the subsequent mutual recriminations that almost inevitably follow, I sometimes think that people talk too lightly about what is a serious act.
