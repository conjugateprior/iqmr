Subsection , as has been said, is no more than a fairly accurate, indeed, in my view, wholly accurate codification of the existing law of England as I understand it. My hon. Friend the Member for Stratford on Avon (Mr. Maude) asked me to express a view on this. I think that subsection does no more than what is generally understood in England to be the present law on the subject. I think that it is useful that the clarification should be put into statutory form. It is a good thing that we should put into a Statute what is generally understood. Neither the Court of Criminal Appeal nor the House of Lords has ever considered this subject and subsection will remove some anxiety from doctors in this respect, although I do not think that they need have very much.
