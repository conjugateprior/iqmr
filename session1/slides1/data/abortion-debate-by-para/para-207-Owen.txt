In the medical profession there is full recognition of the difficulties created by the present situation. We know that we shall not stop back-street abortion, but there is a feeling in the medical profession that many women are stopped from going to their doctors to discuss their pregnancies because of the present legal situation. If we allow abortion to become lawful under certain conditions, a woman will go to her doctor and discuss with him the problems which arise. If he is a good doctor, he will listen to her patiently and discuss it with her, and he may well be able to offer that support which is necessary for her to continue to full term and successfully to have a child.
