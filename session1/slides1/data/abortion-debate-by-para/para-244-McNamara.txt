Let us also consider the difficulties and dangers of widening the grounds for abortion. In its report the Royal College points out that the danger of death from abortion is more than it is with normal birth, that the danger of non-fatal but serious complications is as high as 3 per cent., and that there is a danger from postoperative psychoses which is variously estimated at between 9 and 59 per cent. ; and even 9 per cent. is alarmingly high. I agree that there is a very delicate argument, a very nice argument, but the danger here is that these psychoses are, unfortunately, very difficult to treat, because they often arise from a feeling of guilt which all too clearly has a factual basis, being based on the denial of the maternal instinct and the natural law and I put it no higher than that. 'This is a fact which the supporters of the Bill on this ground should weigh most carefully when they advance the argument of the need for abortion as a cure for the psychoses of pregnancy.
