Nevertheless, as was said by the hon. Member for Sutton, who has much greater knowledge and experience than I have, there is a difficult borderline. It is very much a matter of experienced judgment not guesswork as to whether the sort of profound depression, amounting to dangerous melancholia at times, which many of us have seen in cases of quite normal pregnancy, can, in fact, be dealt with medically and whether the woman be brought to her term and helped to produce a happy, healthy child and to become once again a happy healthy mother. Sometimes she can, sometimes she cannot. But it is a very dicey decision to say whether she can or cannot, I suspect, and, therefore, to decide whether one should take the responsibility of terminating a pregnancy which might result in the birth of a normal, happy, healthy and useful child.
