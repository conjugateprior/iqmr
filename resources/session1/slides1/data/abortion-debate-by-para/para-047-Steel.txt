I will give two instances reported in the Press in May this year. In one a 27-year old house surgeon was sentenced to four years' imprisonment in Liverpool for being an accessory before the fact of the manslaughter of his 20-year old student nurse girl friend. She had had an illegal operation which had been performed by another doctor who later committed suicide. In a case reported in the a 24-year-old woman was found dying in a North London street, after having had an abortion Hard cases, as we are always told, make bad law, but a multiplication of bad cases reveal a very bad state of the law.
