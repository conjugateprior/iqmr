 I should like to deal in detail with these three points. The first is that the law should be certain. This demand seems to me to be largely synthetic. It does not seem to come from the medical profession itself. Indeed, the report of the Royal College to which so many hon. Members have referred specifically states: Later, i t states: Further, the report of the Special Committee of the B.M.A. on Therapeutic Abortion argues that the cases in which abortion is necessary to preserve the life or physical health of the mother are now far fewer than they were 30 years ago. There are cases in which the mental health of the mother is said to justify it, but these, too, are decreasing as psychiatry advances. I agree that on medical grounds there seems to be a fair balance between these points.
