Clause 1(1, ) differs from Lord Silkin's Bill in that as well as covering the case of a woman who is defective or who becomes pregnant under 16 it adds rape as a ground for abortion. I would imagine that most hon. Members who are not opposed to the principle of the Bill would regard rape as a reasonable ground for abortion, though perhaps not in the form in which this is put in the paragraph. The fundamental problem here really is that if I may so express it the processes of human gestation are much quicker than those of the British legal system. It is very difficult to get a conviction or decision on the indictable offence of rape until the pregnancy has become too far advanced, as most of us would think, for abortion to be a satisfactory solution.
