Most of us have received many letters on this subject, and a gynaecologist, Mr. Peter Diggory some hon. Members may have seen the letter he wrote to in support of the Bill and I also have here a copy of a lecture that he gave at the conference to which I have already referred. He said: that is, the number of women who seek illegal abortions   That is what the House should be trying to do. Whether the Bill does or does not do this is something that we can thrash out in Committee. It is extremely difficult to talk about a subject on which people feel so strongly in a debate like this, but in Committee we can discuss the details of the Bill, and how it can work.
