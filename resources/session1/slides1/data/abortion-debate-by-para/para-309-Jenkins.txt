The House will not be surprised when I say that the Government's collective attitude to the Bill is one of neutrality. Abortion is a controversial subject on which wildly differing views are held both in this House and in the country. These two facts in themselves would not, of course, preclude Government legislation on a subject. If they did, the House would be very much less troubled by legislation than it is at present. But this diversity of opinion cuts fairly sharply across party lines. It cuts in some surprising ways.
