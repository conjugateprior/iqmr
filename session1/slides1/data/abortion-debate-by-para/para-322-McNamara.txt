I appreciate the point that my right hon. Friend is making, but would he not agree with me that in the normal family unit the child is the responsibility of both the father and the mother, and that the father's wishes in this matter must also bear very gravely on this issue, as well as the mother's, though I grant that it is the mother who has the primary interest, as having to bear the child in the womb?
