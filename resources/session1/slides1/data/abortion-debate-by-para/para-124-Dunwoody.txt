I tried to follow the argument of my hon. and learned Friend very carefully. It seemed that the whole case he was putting was based on the position of the junior hospital doctor and the position very simply of the doctor who had a religious or conscientious objection to taking part in abortions in hospital. Of course that doctor is facing that position today in legal abortions, and he has to face a very similar position in many other medical fields because medicine is about life and death. I believe that the attitude of the vast majority of doctors to their colleagues who have objections, particularly those with religious objections, to abortion is such that if the Bill is passed no junior doctor in any British hospital will be forced to do anything by his seniors which is obviously against his conscience.
