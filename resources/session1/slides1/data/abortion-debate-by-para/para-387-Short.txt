I am not suggesting that the House should consider introducing the rather cumbersome machinery which Sweden has introduced. It is interesting that the Swedes have now set up a commission to examine the question of liberalising their law, because they feel that their present system is too cumbersome and that too many women have to wait too long before termination can be carried out. I submit that we have evidence on which to go forward on this ground.
