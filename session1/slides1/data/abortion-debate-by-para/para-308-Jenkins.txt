I congratulate the hon. Member for Roxburgh, Selkirk and Peebles (Mr. David Steel) on the force and clarity with which he explained the provisions of the Bill to the House. We can also, whatever our views about the Bill, pay tribute to his sincerity and courage as well as his luck in the Ballot which made it possible for him to introduce this Bill.
