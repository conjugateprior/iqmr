In Scotland, the situation is slightly better ordered as it frequently is. There the procuring of an abortion is a Common Law offence ; there is no Statute Law. But criminal intent must be proved. The Scots law therefore recognises that in certain circumstances it may be necessary, in the interests of the mother and in good faith, to carry out an abortion  something which English law does not specifically recognise.
