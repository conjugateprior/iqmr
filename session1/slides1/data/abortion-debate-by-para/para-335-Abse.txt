The Home Secretary has, characteristically, made a courageous speech, and it is one which we would expect of him. However, he commented that he has noticed that among those who are involved with this Second Reading there are considerable differences of opinion and indeed opinions which he may regard as eccentric to the contributors is that I doubt whether anyone can view a Bill of this kind with enthusiasm. Although I do not go as far as the hon. Member for Chelmsford (Mr. St. John-Stevas), who appears to take such a view that he is minded to vote against the Bill, it would be wrong to say that I can view the Bill with any enthusiasm.
