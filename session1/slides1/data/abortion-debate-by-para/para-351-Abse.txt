Easy talk of this kind, suggesting that one gets a certificate as if one were having a few days off work in a serious matter of this kind, shows an extraordinary naivety. More seriously and to the point, there are some aspects in these Clauses, such as that which deals with the position of the schoolgirl mother, which show a lamentable lack of understanding. I am proud to be associated with the National Council for the Unmarried Mother and Her Child. The Council recently held a conference to discuss" Pregnancy in Adolescence" in which a number of important contributions were made.
