I wish now to speak about the girl under 16. Does anyone think that the problem of the 15-year-old mother can be solved by taking the easy way out? This category which comes under subsection (1,d) is almost negatived a little later in the Bill by Clause 3(1), because in nine cases out of ten a girl of this age who finds that she is having a baby does not tell anyone that she is pregnant until about the fifth month, by which time she would not be able to get an abortion under the Bill anyway, and by which time having an abortion would be very dangerous. Even supposing that she is the tenth girl and does tell, here is the case of a perfectly healthy baby being sacrificed for the mother's convenience.
