When one considers the attitudes of the professions in the two pamphlets I have mentioned, it is noteworthy that the proposal of paragraph is not supported either by the Royal College or by the B.M.A. Both make it clear that they do not support the termination of pregnancy for non-medical reasons and that they think that it would be most unfair to place any such burden on doctors. I agree with that view.
