It is thoroughly proper that legislation on abortion should be dealt with by a Private Member's Bill, with the Whips off and with all hon. Members entirely free to vote according to their personal convictions. That free vote will, of course, apply just as much to the individual members of the Government as it does to anybody else. But while the Government's collective attitude must remain one of neutrality, we should be glad to give drafting assistance should the House decide to give the Bill a Second Reading and should such assistance be necessary or desirable either before the Committee stage or between the Committee and the Report stages.
