It is not pleasant or easy for me to speak in this House on something on which I have a perfect right to utter privacy, but I must say that I am in the position, with my family almost grown up, and having a job to do here in this House, that it would be disastrous for me if I were to start having another baby. Yet, in my position here, I beg the House to believe that I speak with absolute sincerity. I cannot, with all the information that is before me, find it in my heart right to support this Bill which regards getting rid of an innocent baby as something that is right.
