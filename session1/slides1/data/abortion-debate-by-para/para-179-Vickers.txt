I think that we would all agree that where the physical health of an expectant mother is in danger there is little difficulty in obtaining action. Nevertheless, if we can make a change in the law it can be of great advantage to a woman, because she will know that she can go quite openly to her general practitioner. Dr. Joan Malleson, writing in the said: There is also the question of spontaneous abortions. A great number of abortions are spontaneous, and nobody says that in those circumstances the mothers have killed their children. According to a report of a survey made in Charing Cross Hospital, of 208 cases there were 109 spontaneous abortions, 45 induced abortions and 54 cases where the cause was not known. Many women lose their children through spontaneous abortion, and nobody suggests that life has been taken they get all our sympathy.
