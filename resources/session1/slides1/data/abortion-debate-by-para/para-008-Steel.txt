Naturally, there are some matters of deep constituency interest which I would have liked to bring forward. It is no secret that I have campaigned in my constituency and in the rest of the country for an extension of the principles contained in the and the use of development authorities for certain areas of the country. Unfortunately, much as I would have liked to introduce something of this kind, it has not been possible to obtain Government support and, quite apart from the practical difficulties involved in any private Member's introducing something for the benefit of his own constituency or his party's propaganda, and also the technical difficulties, there is an issue of principle involved, in that the opportunity to introduce a Private Member's Bill is an almost unique one, which in my opinion should not be used to express a particular point of view for party advantage, perhaps with one eye on the next election. I think that it should be used for something positive whether it be a major or a minor reform which can have a reasonable prospect of arriving on the Statute Book.
