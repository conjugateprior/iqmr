I ask for compassion from the opponents of the Bill. I ask them what course they would urge upon their daughter, pregnant under the age of 16, or by brutal rape, or by a husband who had fecklessly hounded her from pregnancy to pregnancy. Clause 1 (1, ) is particularly welcome. It permits the termination of pregnancy when there is substantial risk of a child emerging with serious physical and mental abnormalities. That proposal is endorsed by the Gerrard Committee of the British Medical Association, by the Abortion Law Reform Association and in a booklet recently published by the Conservative Political Centre.
