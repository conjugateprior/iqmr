The hon. Member for Roxburgh, Selkirk and Peebles (Mr. David Steel) said that he had no children of his own and remarks were made by my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Walsall, North about how he might feel if he had a daughter. I have three children, including one daughter, and if my daughter wanted to become a nurse I would hope that she would be a nurse at a time when the law on abortion would be more enlightened and more rational and more realistic than it is today, and I would not be afraid if she were to come home and tell me of the things which the hon. and learned Member was so alarmed about.
