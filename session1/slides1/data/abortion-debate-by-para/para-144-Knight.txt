 Our reformists appeal to humanity in ridding a woman of an unwanted pregnancy, but they utterly fail to recognise the inhumanity of abortion itself. If we agree that we should have abortion simply because a mother feels she cannot cope with caring for her child, what about the other end of the scale? And it is important to talk about this because plenty of sons and daughters who are grown up and married feel they cannot cope with their elderly parents. Should they be put down, too? [HON. MEMBERS:" Oh."] It is an utterly inhuman doctrine, yet it would be a perfectly logical next step after this Bill.
