 Then again, I understand that it is often not possible to say with any certainty that the child is deformed or a monster until abortion is too late for safety. Abortion is frequently an extremely dangerous operation. Obstetricians hate it. I know from my post that they detest and fear the thought of this Bill becoming law. That is partly because of the danger and partly because they hold in great reverence the solemn oath which they have all sworn to preserve life.
