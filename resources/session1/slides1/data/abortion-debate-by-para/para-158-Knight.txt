One thing above all that I have learned about abortion is these last few weeks is that we do not know enough about what is involved. Like other hon. Members, I have had letters from women's organisations and independent women, and it is clear that the people who have written have not read the Bill. They start, as I did, with enormous sympathy and emotional judgment. But we must judge from knowledge and not emotion.
