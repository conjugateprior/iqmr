I have no hesitation at all no reservation in saying that I believe that, subject to proper safeguards, a pregnancy ought to be medically terminated when there is a clear and grave danger to the life or physical health of the mother. I have, as I think anybody must have, slightly more reservations when we come to mental health, despite the enormous advances in psychiatry not just in specialist psychiatry, but, what is perhaps more important, the increasing knowledge of or familiarity with psychiatric practice on the part of general practitioners. Because of this advance it is much less dangerous to give slightly more latitude here than once it was.
