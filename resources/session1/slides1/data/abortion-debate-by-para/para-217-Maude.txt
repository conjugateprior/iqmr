I turn to the emotive content which is inevitable in the Bill. I, being subject to no religious dogma in this respect I am an Anglican cannot find it in me, and I do not believe I ever shall find it in me, to regard the non-viable foetus in utero as a human personality. I cannot say that I am right to believe this, but nobody can say that I am wrong. I am, therefore, left unmoved by talk of killing unborn babies.
