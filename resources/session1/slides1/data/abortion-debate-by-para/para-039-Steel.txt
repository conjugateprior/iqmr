It is right that I should say something about my attitude to the passage of the Bill in Committee because I have been asked about this by many hon Members. I do not think that there is any point in accepting Amendments from those who are opposed quite rightly from their point of view in principle to the Bill and wile would remain opposed to it no matter which Amendments I accepted. On the other hand, I want to make it clear that this is a difficult matter and that I do not pretend, in spite of all the consultations which we have had, that the Bill is in any way in a perfect form. I believe that it is quite right that the Committee should be open to invite me to accept Amendments, which I shall certainly be prepared to accept, and in any case it will be for the Committee's free decision to decide how the Bill can and should be improved. It is in that spirit that I look forward to the Committee stage.
