I am sorry that my right hon. Friend the Member for Ashford (Mr. Deedes) is not here, but he told us why he had to leave. A well-reasoned document entitled" Abortion. A Conservative view" , has just been published. The group which wrote this document suggests that I am glad that that point has been made. Perhaps that type of wording would have satisfied my right hon. Friend.
