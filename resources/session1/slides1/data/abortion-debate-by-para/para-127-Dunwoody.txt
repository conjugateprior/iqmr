Finally, the objection was raised that this Bill would undermine respect for the sanctity of human life. I would agree with the proposal of the Amendment that this is the most difficult and perhaps the most important part that we should be thinking about. There is, I hope, more to life than merely survival and we should be also thinking about the quality of that survival. I am thinking particularly of the mothers with large families and the burdens of large families very often with low incomes. Sanctity of human life to me does not mean just the human life of one individual. I like to think more of the family unit, of the mother and father and the children. I take it further than that and think of the community as a whole. If one looks at it in that light one can see that far from undermining respect for the sanctity of human life this Bill could enhance respect for human life in the fullest sense of the phrase.
