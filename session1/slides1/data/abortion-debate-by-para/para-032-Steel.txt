Paragraph is perhaps the most difficult paragraph in legal terms. It refers to a pregnant woman being a defective or becoming pregnant while under the age of 16 or becoming pregnant as a result of rape. I believe that all these should be put together in one category. I find it difficult to understand the distinction between, for example, the case of a girl under 16 and a case of rape. In fact, in Scots law if one omitted the reference to a girl under 16, she would in any case be covered by the reference to rape, because intercourse with a girl under 16 is rape in Scots law. I believe that both of these should go into one category and that we should look at the category closely.
