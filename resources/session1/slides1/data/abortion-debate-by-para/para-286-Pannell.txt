I do not think that the right hon. and learned Gentleman is stating the position fairly. My hon. Friend the Member for Falmouth and Camborne (Dr. John Dunwoody) did not want to solve social and economic problems. He wanted to solve, as a doctor, the impact of a social or economic problem upon his patient. The duty is to the patient. He is not asking for for doctors in this respect. The right hon. and learned Gentleman is usually most fair, and I hope that he will acknowledge this.
