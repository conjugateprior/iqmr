The present law dealing with abortion requires clarification and amendment. To that extent, I welcome the Bill. I think that it is necessary that we should do something about the present law and that it is both necessary and desirable that it should be not only clarified, but also amended. To that extent, I greatly welcome the bringing forward of the Bill and the discussion of the subject today. It is of considerable importance to the public generally in their individual lives and the way in which they can or cannot receive medical help in dealing with the problems of parenthood and conception.
