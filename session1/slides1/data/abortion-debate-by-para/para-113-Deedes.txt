My own instinct is against even paragraph . Granted, medical science can now forecast foetal abnormalities with greater certainty than ever before, and the certainty is becoming greater all the time. It seems to me a very big decision, and it must always be a medical decision, to declare that a life must be condemned unseen. But I am persuaded by the attitude of the medical profession itself and by members of my own Church that the law should be changed. Well, so be it.
