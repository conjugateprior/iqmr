I have spoken at length on some of the what might be termed Committee points of the Bill because of what the hon. Member for Roxburgh, Selkirk and Peebles said in moving the Bill about the attitude he would take to people who were opposed to it. I have therefore felt that I must elaborate this case, because there are many points of substance which legally I do not think bear examination, besides the objections that I have from my own convictions.
