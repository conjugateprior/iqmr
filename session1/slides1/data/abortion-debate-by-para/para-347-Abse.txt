 Before we turn to the serious operation of aborton we should consider all the medical opinion, and the question whether there are alternatives. I do not understand why, so far, nobody has referred to the fact that the Royal College, with all its knowledge, has said that it is a far less dangerous operation almost a slight operation for a man to be sterilised. But I have noticed that if one says to a man," Look, if a working class woman has six or seven children and is worn out, and there is every probability that she will have another one, do you agree that she should be sterilised?" he will often agree, but if one puts to him the reverse possibility the sterilisation of the man, which could end the dilemma of the working class family in such circumstances he recoils, because he regards it as an assault upon his own masculinity. There is not the same reaction when one suggests that action should be taken by way of an abortion which many women regard as an assault upon their femininity.
