An alternative way of doing it, although possibly slightly dubious, would be to leave it out and to put in another interpretation of the word" health". An alternative which was suggested was that if one takes the definition of" health" contained in the World Health Organisation's constitution, that is so worded as to include, as it does, social well-being, so that the cases which we have in mind could be covered. But, again, that is not as satisfactory as being absolutely clear what we mean. Paragraph may not be as well worded as many hon. Members would wish. I understand that the Home Secretary has some improvement to suggest in it. I am quite open to all suggestions for improving the wording of the Clause, but I think that we must bear in mind some of the cases which are on the borderline between social, economic cases and purely medical cases.
