I should also like to thank my hon. Friend the Member for Falmouth and Camborne (Dr. John Dunwoody) who gave a considered medical opinion which was very valuable to the House. His contribution to the definition of the inadquate mother and the stresses and strains which a mother can undergo when she suffers too many pregnancies in the wrong circumstances was invaluable.
