I turn to the Bill itself. Like the hon. and learned Member for Walsall, North (Mr. William Wells), I should not be opposing the Bill if it consisted only of Clause 1 (1, ). I think that was the point that the hon. and learned Gentleman made in moving his Amendment. I accept Clause 1 (1, ). It is only in the knowledge that it cannot and will not stand alone in the Bill that I think it right to adopt the attitude which I do adopt to the Bill itself, because, reluctantly, I cannot accept the remaining three paragraphs of Clause 1(1) in the same way.
