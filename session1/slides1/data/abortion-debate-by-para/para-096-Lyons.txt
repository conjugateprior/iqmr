I have also come across the more expensive back-bedroom abortion by the hasty medical man whose patient returns to a distant town, there to lie in terror and blood and without medical attention. We must think, too, of all these women who, by the use of a variety of pills and liquids and instruments, make attempts upon themselves. Had this Bill been law, it would not have helped all such women, but at least it would have succoured those who came within its very limited categories.
