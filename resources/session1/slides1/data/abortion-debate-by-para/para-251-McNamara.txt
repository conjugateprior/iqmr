It is also strange that abnormalities which we are able to diagnose within the womb we are prepared to terminate, while those which cannot be diagnosed until after birth we are to let live, things like epilepsy, biochemical disorders and mental defects. Who are we to judge to say that those who are born abnormal but not diagnosed should live, while the child who may be born blind or deaf because its mother may have contracted German measles or had a sweat rash is to be condemned to die? Who are we to make the judgment? Who is the mother to make the judgment?
