There was a letter in this morning from a gynaecologist which illustrated the point which I am making. He supported the Bill really on the ground that it would open the way for medicine deliberately to try to improve congenitally the human stock by scientific means. I am not so optimistic or foolish as to believe that one can stop the progress of science in this way, for it is in the nature of man to ask questions. If he asks them, he will try to find answers to them. If he finds the answers, he will try to act on them. Nothing can stop man behaving in this way. But he had better watch out that some of the answers which he gets do not beg even larger questions.
