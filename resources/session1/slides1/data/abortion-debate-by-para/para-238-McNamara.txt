In its extreme form, I think that this argument becomes the alleged right of every expectant mother to decide whether her child shall be born or destroyed, but I grant that the Bill does not go this far. Finally, they say that it is inhumane because many women suffer great pain and hardship because they have had to have recourse to a back-street abortionist. The third reason which the proposers of the Bill put forward is that the administration of the law has broken down, that it is neither respected nor obeyed. I could never defend a situation in which there is one law for the rich and another for the poor.
