The next point is that concerning a woman who becomes pregnant while under the age of 16. I concede that there are very many circumstances in which the physical and mental development of the mother is one which would lead any doctor to terminate the pregnancy I am happy to leave it to any doctor to say under paragraph whether the consequences to a mother who is young, and exceedingly young, are such that she should have her pregnancy terminated. I do not even mind if he decides that a girl over 16, who is very immature, both physically and mentally, should have her pregnancy terminated. I cannot see that the age of 16 has any magic.
