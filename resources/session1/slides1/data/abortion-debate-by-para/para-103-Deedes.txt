It is very pleasant and very easy to congratulate the hon. Member for Bradford, East (Mr. Edward Lyons) on his maiden speech. As he told us, he deliberately embarked on a very brave course of action. He waited until a controversial Bill of this complexity came before the House before he made his maiden speech. I recall no maiden speech which has been addressed to a more difficult subject and I think that he has acquitted himself splendidly. The House will look forward to hearing from the hon. Member again.
