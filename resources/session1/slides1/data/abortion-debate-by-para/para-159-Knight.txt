In the present climate, suitably prepared with heavily slanted propaganda, it may be that society says that a woman should have an abortion on demand and that if excuses are wanted for the squeamish they can be easily invented. Those responsible for administering our society should behave responsibly. Yet we see Private Members' Bills introduced to both Houses before there has been an adequate collection of evidence by an independent tribunal. If we are to change the law, it should be done by a society which is fully informed of the facts. At present, this country has had information only from the mass media in the form of radio and television programmes and Press reports.
