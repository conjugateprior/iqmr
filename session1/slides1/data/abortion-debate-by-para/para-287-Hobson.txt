I certainly accept that that was one way of expressing the view of the hon. Gentleman, but I still do not think that it is an acceptable basis. One should not put into the hands of doctors the right to terminate a prospective life because in an individual case the mother has a social or economic problem that could face her in the future. I think that the drafting of the paragraph is very vague. I do not know what" capacity as a mother" means. I have never heard the phrase before. How long has that capacity to be overstrained one year, three years, ten years, six months? We do not know anything about that. The paragraph gives to doctors to apply in individual cases pretty well whatever views they may take on difficult questions and I do not think that it is right to place on the medical profession generally the right to take these decisions
