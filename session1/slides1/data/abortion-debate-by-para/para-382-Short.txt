The Inter-Departmental Committee of almost 30 years ago accepted the figure of 50,000 illegal abortions a year. Of course, there has been variation in the figures put forward since, but the most recent National Opinion Poll, which, significantly, was carried out among women  and it is women who have babies and it is women who have abortions, legal and illegal, and it is women who are in a position to answer these questions makes it clear that there are about 40,000 a year and that in addition there are about 85,000 attempted illegal abortions a year, induced or attempted to be induced by the woman herself, or by the back-street illegal abortionist to whom desperate women will go.
